\chapter{Graph rewriting}

The results of the previous chapter have given us a combinatorial setting in
which string diagrams equal by topological deformations or by the equations of
commutative comonoids are translated into isomorphic cospans of hypergraphs.
This form is beneficial because it is far more suitable for feeding to a
computer.

While the equations of commutative comonoids are already absorbed into the
notation, we want to reason about the equations of some arbitrary
\emph{monoidal theory}.
In our case, this is the monoidal theory of sequential digital circuits.
