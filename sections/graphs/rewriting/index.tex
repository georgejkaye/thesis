\begin{definition}[Monomorphism]
    A morphism \(\morph{f}{A}{B}\) is a called a \emph{monomorphism} (or simply
    \emph{mono} for short) if for all morphisms \(\morph{g,h}{C}{A}\), \(
        f \circ g = f \circ h \Rightarrow g = h
    \).
\end{definition}

Hypergraph categories always compact closed noted in \cite{carboni1987cartesian}.

\begin{example}
    A morphism in \(\set\) is mono if and only if it is an injection.
\end{example}
