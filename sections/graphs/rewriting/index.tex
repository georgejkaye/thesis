\chapter{Graph rewriting}

The results of the previous chapter have given us a combinatorial setting in
which string diagrams equal by topological deformations or by the equations of
commutative comonoids are translated into isomorphic cospans of hypergraphs.
This already gives us a straightforward way to interpret these structures
computationally.

However, it is very rare that we will only be working modulo the equations of
traced comonoids; we will often also have the equations of a
\emph{monoidal theory} to worry about.
Since an equation \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=f,colour=white]
    =
    \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=g,colour=white]
\) may actually change the components of the term, there is no reason for the
interpretations \(
    \termandfrobtohypsigmac[
        \tracedandcomonoidtofrobsigmac[
            \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=f,colour=white]
        ]
    ]
\) and \(
    \termandfrobtohypsigmac[
        \tracedandcomonoidtofrobsigmac[
            \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=g,colour=white]
        ]
    ]
\) to be isomorphic.
Instead, to reason about cospans of hypergraphs modulo the equations of some
monoidal theory we must \emph{rewrite} the components of the graph.

Performing rewriting in this way is common in computer science and accordingly
there is a wealth of knowledge on both
term~\cite{knuth1970simple,gadduchi1996algebraic} and graph~\cite{}

Rewriting for string diagrams has its roots in Burroni's work on
polygraphs~\cite{burroni}

This approach even briefly entered our world of digital circuits in Lafont's
work on Boolean circuits~\cite{lafont2003algebraic}, which used a rudimentary
form of graphical syntactic rewriting.
However, in this approach even the axioms of SMCs needed to be applied
explicitly, greatly hampering the tractability of the system.

It is only more recently that \emph{graph rewriting} for string diagrams has
been studied, first with the aforementioned \emph{string graphs} of Dixon and
Kissinger~\cite{dixon2010open,kissinger2012pictures,dixon2013opengraphs}.
This only considered rewriting in the presence of a trace rather than
considering any additional structure, but nevertheless was successfully
implemented in a proof assistant called
Quantomatic~\cite{kissinger2015quantomatic}.
Instead, our work continues to closely follow that of Bonchi et
al~\cite{bonchi2022string,bonchi2022stringa}, which has several advantages
over string graphs.
Unlike the category of string graphs, the category of hypergraphs is
\emph{adhesive}~\cite{lack2004adhesive} which affords it some nice rewriting
properties.
Moreover, rewriting modulo Frobenius structure (or even just monoid or comonoid
structure) can reveal rewrites `hidden' behind the absorbed equations that might
not be seen with the naked eye.
