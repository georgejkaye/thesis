\chapter{Graph rewriting}

The results of the previous chapter have given us a combinatorial setting in
which string diagrams equal by topological deformations or by the equations of
commutative comonoids are translated into isomorphic cospans of hypergraphs.
This already gives us a straightforward way to interpret these structures
computationally.

However, it is very rare that we will only be working modulo the equations of
traced comonoids; we will often also have the equations of a
\emph{monoidal theory} to worry about.
Since an equation \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=f,colour=white]
    =
    \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=g,colour=white]
\) may actually change the components of the term, there is no reason for the
interpretations \(
    \termandfrobtohypsigmac[
        \tracedandcomonoidtofrobsigmac[
            \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=f,colour=white]
        ]
    ]
\) and \(
    \termandfrobtohypsigmac[
        \tracedandcomonoidtofrobsigmac[
            \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=g,colour=white]
        ]
    ]
\) to be isomorphic.
Instead, to reason about cospans of hypergraphs modulo the equations of some
monoidal theory we must \emph{rewrite} the components of the graph.
