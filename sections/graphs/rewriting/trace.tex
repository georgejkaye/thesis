\section{Rewriting with traced structure}

In the Frobenius setting, every pushout complement is a valid rewrite, but there
is no reason for the same to be the case for traced or traced comonoid
rewriting.
Bonchi et al showed in~\cite{bonchi2022stringa} that \emph{exactly one} pushout
complement corresponds to a valid rewrite in the symmetric monoidal case by
characterising it as a \emph{boundary complement}.

For traced and traced comonoid rewriting, some pushout complements are valid and
some are not.
We will adapt the notion of boundary complements to identify those that are.
