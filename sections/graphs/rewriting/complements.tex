\section{Pushout complements}

\index{pushout complement}
While computing the rewritten graph from a context is a deterministic procedure,
finding the pushout complement specifying said context
is a little more subtle.

\begin{definition}
    \index{matching}
    A morphism \(i+j \to L \to G\) is called a \emph{matching} if it
    has at least one pushout complement.
\end{definition}

If there is no pushout complement, there is no possible rewrite, so it is
important to know when one exists.
Fortunately, there are two well-known conditions for existence of pushout
complements when rewriting with hypergraphs.
The first ensures that all the sources and targets of a hyperedge are present
in a candidate context.

\begin{definition}[No-dangling-hyperedges condition~\cite{corradini1997algebraic}, Prop.\ 3.3.4]
    \index{no-dangling-hyperedges condition}
    Given morphisms \(i+j \xrightarrow{a} L \xrightarrow{f} G\) in
    \(\hypsigma\), they satisfy the \emph{no-dangling} condition if, for every
    hyperedge not in
    the image of \(f\), each of its source and target vertices is either not in
    the image of \(f\) or are in the image of \(f \circ a\).
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    The following pair of morphisms does not satisfy the no-dangling-hyperedges
    condition.
    \[
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/no-dangling/k}
        \xrightarrow{a}
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/no-dangling/l}
        \xrightarrow{f}
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/no-dangling/g}
    \]
    To obtain the pushout complement we `cut out' any vertices in the
    rightmost graph which are in the image of \(f\) but not the image of
    \(f \circ a\), as the latter are the interfaces of the rule.
    However, if we cut out the vertices labelled \(2\) and \(3\), the edge
    \(e_2\) will be left with `dangling' tentacles connected to no vertices, a
    malformed hypergraph.
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/no-dangling/l}
            \arrow{d}{f}
            &
            \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/no-dangling/k}
            \arrow{l}{a}
            \arrow{d}
            \\
            \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/no-dangling/g}
            &
            \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/no-dangling/c}
            \arrow{l}
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
\end{example}

The second condition enforces that merging of vertices is well-defined.

\begin{definition}[No-identification condition~\cite{corradini1997algebraic}, Prop.\ 3.3.4]
    \index{no-identification condition}
    Given morphisms \(i+j \xrightarrow{a} L \xrightarrow{f} G\) in
    \(\hypsigma\), they satisfy the \emph{no-identification} condition if any
    two distinct elements merged by \(f\) are also in the image of \(f \circ a\).
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    The following does not satisfy the no-identification
    condition.
    \[
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/no-identification/k}
        \xrightarrow{a}
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/no-identification/l}
        \xrightarrow{f}
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/no-identification/g}
    \]
    When trying to construct a pushout complement, the edge \(e_2\) will be
    removed.
    However, since vertices \(2\) and \(3\) are not mapped from the rule
    interfaces, there is no reason that a pushout would glue them together so
    that they are merged in the final graph.
    Therefore no pushout complement can exist.
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/no-identification/l}
            \arrow{d}{f}
            &
            \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/no-identification/k}
            \arrow{l}{a}
            \arrow{d}
            \\
            \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/no-identification/g}
            &
            \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/no-identification/c}
            \arrow{l}
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
\end{example}

With these two conditions, we can establish when pushout complements exist for
a pair of hypergraph homomorphisms.
If there is a pushout complement, then there is an opportunity for a rewrite.

\begin{proposition}[\cite{corradini1997algebraic}, Prop.\ 3.3.4]
    \label{prop:pushout-complement}
    The morphisms \(i+j \to L \to G \in \hypsigma\) have at least one pushout
    complement if and only if they satisfy the no-dangling and no-identification
    conditions.
\end{proposition}

It is all very well knowing if there is at least one pushout complement, but
what about when there is \emph{exactly one} pushout complement?
When this is the case, the rewrite is uniquely specified for a given rule and
matching.
To answer this question, we must examine a class of categories to which
\(\hypsigma\) belongs, known as \emph{adhesive} categories.
One can think of these as categories in which graph rewriting `plays nicely'.

To define what an adhesive category is, we must first define a special kind of
pushout that interacts in a particular way with other pushouts and pullbacks.

\begin{definition}[van Kampen square {\cite[Def.\ 2.1]{lack2005adhesive}}]
    \index{van Kampen square}
    \index{VK square}
    Let there be a commutative cube as drawn below.
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            G \arrow{rrr} \arrow{ddd} &
            &
            &
            H \arrow{ddd} \\
            &
            E \arrow{ul} \arrow{r} \arrow{d} &
            F \arrow{ur} \arrow{d} &
            \\
            &
            A \arrow{dl} \arrow{r} &
            B \arrow{dr} &
            \\
            C \arrow{rrr} &
            &
            &
            D
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    The bottom face of the cube (\(ABCD\)) is called a
    \emph{van Kampen (VK) square} if it is a pushout and, when the back and
    left faces (\(EFAB\) and \(GECA\)) are pullbacks, the front and right faces
    (\(GHCD\) and \(FHBD\)) are pullbacks if and only if the top face (\(GHEF\))
    is a pushout.
\end{definition}

In an adhesive category, VK squares arise when performing pushouts of
\emph{monomorphisms}.
This is important for graph rewriting because monomorphisms in categories of
graphs generally correspond to \emph{embeddings}; graph homomorphisms where
subgraphs can be `cut out' of a graph without causing the rest of the graph to
become degenerate.

\begin{definition}
    \index{pushout!along a monomorphism}
    Given a span \(\spann{A}[f]{B}[g]{C}\) with a pushout \(\cospan{B}{D}{C}\),
    the pushout is called a \emph{pushout along a monomorphism} if \(f\) or
    \(g\) is a monomorphism.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Adhesive category {\cite[Def.\ 3.1]{lack2005adhesive}}]
    \index{adhesive category|textbf}
    \index{category!adhesive}
    A category is \emph{adhesive} if
    \begin{itemize}
        \item it has pushouts along monomorphisms;
        \item it has pullbacks; and
        \item pushouts along monomorphisms are VK squares.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

The definition of van Kampen square and subsequently adhesive categories may
look a bit confusing to the uninitiated.
Succinctly, objects in an adhesive category can
be `split apart' and `glued together' by using pushouts and pullbacks.

\begin{example}
    A natural example of an adhesive category is \(\set\), which has pushouts
    and pullbacks.
    To get some idea how the van Kampen condition holds, consider the
    following commutative cube in \(\set\), adapted from
    \cite[Sec.\ 4.3]{kissinger2012pictures}.
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            A^\prime
            \arrow{rrr}
            \arrow{ddd}{f_A}
            &
            &
            &
            X
            \arrow{ddd}{f}
            \\
            &
            A^\prime \cap B^\prime
            \arrow{r}
            \arrow{d}
            \arrow{ul}
            &
            B^\prime
            \arrow{ur}
            \arrow{d}{f_B}
            &
            \\
            &
            A \cap B
            \arrow{r}
            \arrow{dl}
            &
            B
            \arrow{dr}
            &
            \\
            A
            \arrow{rrr}
            &
            &
            &
            A \cup B
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    The bottom face is a pushout, and since \(A \cup B \to A\) and
    \(A \cup B \to B\) are monomorphisms, this is a pushout along a
    monomorphism.
    Furthermore, the left and back faces are pullbacks because \(f_A\) and
    \(f_B\) agree on the intersection of \(A^\prime\) and \(B^\prime\).

    Now we must show that the front and right faces are pullbacks if and only if
    the top face is a pushout.
    For the front and right faces to be pullbacks, \(f\) must restrict to
    \(f_A\) and \(f_B\) along \(A\) and \(B\).
    This can only be the case if and only if \(X = A^\prime \cap B^\prime\), in
    which case the top square must be a pushout.
\end{example}

Proving the necessary van Kampen condition might be tricky.
Fortunately, adhesivity is preserved by several categorical constructions, so
by using \(\set\) as a base it is straightforward to show that more complicated
categories are also adhesive.

\begin{proposition}[\cite{lack2005adhesive}, Prop.\ 3.5]
    For an adhesive category \(\mcc\) and object \(C\) of \(\mcc\),
    \(\mcc \slice C\) is adhesive.
    Given another category \(\mcx\), \([\mcx, \mcc]\) is also adhesive.
\end{proposition}

\begin{corollary}
    \(\hypsigma\) and \(\hypsigmac\) are adhesive.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
    \(\hypsigma\) and \(\hypsigmac\) are defined as the slice of a functor
    category over \(\set\), so they are adhesive.
\end{proof}

The key property adhesive categories enjoy is that, for certain DPO rules, a
pushout complement is \emph{uniquely} defined for a given matching.

\begin{definition}[Left-linear rules]
    A DPO rule \(\spann{L}[f]{i+j}{R}\) is called \emph{left-linear} if \(f\)
    is mono.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[\cite{lack2005adhesive}, Lem.\ 4.5]
    In an adhesive category, if a pushout complement exists for morphisms
    \(I \xrightarrow{m} L \to G\) and \(m\) is a monomorphism, then it is unique
    up to isomorphism.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The proof relies on several non-trivial lemmas that hold in adhesive
    categories in addition to some other results about pushouts.
    We refer the interested reader to
    \cite[Lems. 4.3.6 - 4.3.9]{kissinger2012pictures} for the grisly details.
\end{proof}

However, there may be useful rewrite rules which are \emph{not} left-linear.

\begin{example}\label{ex:non-left-linear}
    Consider the following (reasonable) rule.
    \[
        \rrule{
            \iltikzfig{strings/category/identity}
        }{
            \iltikzfig{strings/category/generator}[box=e]
        }
        \qquad
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/l}
        \leftarrow
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/k}
        \to
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/r}
    \].
    Now consider applying the above rule to the term
    \(\iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/g-term}\) using the following pair
    of morphisms:
    \[
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/k}
        \to
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/l}
        \to
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/g}
    \]
    This matching yields the following pushout complements and rewrites:
    \begin{gather*}
        \scalebox{0.9}{\iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/c1}}
        \to
        \scalebox{0.9}{\iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/h1}}
        \\[0.5em]
        \scalebox{0.9}{\iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/c2}}
        \to
        \scalebox{0.9}{\iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/h2}}
        \\[0.5em]
        \scalebox{0.9}{\iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/c3}}
        \to
        \scalebox{0.9}{\iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/h3}}
        \,\,
        \scalebox{0.9}{\iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/c4}}
        \to
        \scalebox{0.9}{\iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/h4}}
        \\
        \scalebox{0.9}{\iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/c5}}
        \to
        \scalebox{0.9}{\iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/h5}}
    \end{gather*}
\end{example}

One might think this is undesirable, but these multiple rewrites actually arise
due to the presence of the Frobenius algebra.

\begin{example}
    Each of the five complements and rewrites in \cref{ex:non-left-linear}
    corresponds to a valid application of equations on terms, perhaps modulo
    Frobenius equations.
    The first complement \(
    \scalebox{0.9}{\iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/h1}}
    \) is the `obvious' one:
    \begin{gather*}
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/g-term}
        =
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/g-term-rewrite-1-2}
    \end{gather*}
    The complement \(
    \scalebox{0.9}{\iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/h2}}
    \) uses the compact closed structure:
    \begin{gather*}
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/g-term}
        =
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/g-term-rewrite-2-0}
        =
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/g-term-rewrite-2-3}
    \end{gather*}
    The complement \(
    \scalebox{0.9}{\iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/h3}}
    \) uses the unitality of the monoid:
    \begin{gather*}
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/g-term}
        =
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/g-term-rewrite-3-0}
        =
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/g-term-rewrite-3-3}
    \end{gather*}
    The complement \(
    \scalebox{0.9}{\iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/h4}}
    \) uses the counitality of the comonoid:
    \begin{gather*}
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/g-term}
        =
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/g-term-rewrite-4-0}
        =
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/g-term-rewrite-4-3}
    \end{gather*}
    The complement \(
    \scalebox{0.9}{\iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/h5}}
    \) uses the Frobenius equations:
    \begin{gather*}
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/g-term}
        =
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/g-term-rewrite-5-0}
        =
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/g-term-rewrite-5-1}
        =
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/g-term-rewrite-5-2}
        =
        \\
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/g-term-rewrite-5-3}
        =
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/g-term-rewrite-5-4}
        =
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-left-linear/g-term-rewrite-5-7}
    \end{gather*}
\end{example}

The problem of finding each possible pushout complement has already been
tackled for hypergraphs~\cite{heumuller2011construction}; they can be enumerated
as quotients of an `exploded' context.

\begin{definition}[{\cite[Const.\ 1]{heumuller2011construction}}]
    \index{exploded context}
    For morphisms \(i+j \to L \xrightarrow{f} G\) in \(\hypsigma\),
    their \emph{exploded context} is the graph
    \(i + j + \tilde{G}\) where \(\tilde{G}\) constructed as follows:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item for each vertex \(v \in G\) not in the image of \(f\), add one
              vertex to \(\tilde{G}\);
        \item for each hyperedge \(e \in G\) not in the image of \(f\), add one
              hyperedge to \(\tilde{G}\);
        \item for each hyperedge \(e \in \tilde{G}\), let the \(i\)-th source
              \(\tilde{s_i}(e)\) be defined as \(s_i(h)\) if
              \(s_i(h) \in \tilde{G}\) or a new, fresh vertex otherwise;
        \item repeat the above for the targets.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Pushout complements can then be computed as quotients of this exploded
context.

\begin{proposition}[\cite{heumuller2011construction} (Props. 3-4), \cite{bonchi2022string}]
    For a pair of morphisms \(i+j \to L \to G\) in \(\hypsigma\), let
    \(i + j + \tilde{G}\) be its exploded context.
    Define a map \(\morph{q}{i + j + \tilde{G}}{G}\) sending elements in
    \(\tilde{G}\) from \(G\) to themselves, and sending vertices from
    \(i + j\) to their image under \(i + j \to L \to G\).
    Then a pushout complement \(i + j \to C \to G\) is valid if and only the
    context \(C\) is a quotient on the exploded context that only identifies
    vertices in the image of \(q^{-1}(v)\) for each vertex \(v \in G\).
\end{proposition}

Given a DPO rule and matching, we can enumerate all pushout complements; each of
these corresponds to a valid rewrite in a Frobenius setting.

\begin{notation}
    For a rule \(
    \rrule{
        \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=l,colour=white,dom=i,cod=j]
    }{
        \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=r,colour=white,dom=i,cod=j]
    } \in \smcsigma + \frob
    \), its DPO rule is defined as \(
    \termandfrobtohypsigma[
        \rrule{
            \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=l,colour=white]
        }{
            \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=r,colour=white]
        }
    ]
    \coloneqq
    \spann{
        \termandfrobtohypsigma[
            \foldinterfaces[
                \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=l,colour=white]
            ]
        ]
    }{i+j}{
        \termandfrobtohypsigma[
            \foldinterfaces[
                \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=r,colour=white]
            ]
        ]
    }
    \).
\end{notation}

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Thm.\ 4.9]{bonchi2022string}}]
    For rule \(r \in \smcsigma + \frob\), we have that \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=g,colour=white]
    \rewrite[r]
    \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=h,colour=white]
    \) if and only if \(
    \termandfrobtohypsigma[
        \foldinterfaces[
            \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=g,colour=white]
        ]
    ]
    \grewrite[\termandfrobtohypsigma[r]
    ]
    \termandfrobtohypsigma[
        \foldinterfaces[
            \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=g,colour=white]
        ]
    ].\)
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Multicoloured rewriting}

The results generalise in the obvious way to the coloured setting.

\begin{notation}
    For a term rewrite rule \(
    \rrule{
        \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=l,colour=white,dom=\listvar{i},cod=\listvar{j}]
    }{
        \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=r,colour=white,dom=\listvar{i},cod=\listvar{j}]
    }
    \) in \(\smcsigmac + \frobc\), its interpretation as a DPO rule is defined
