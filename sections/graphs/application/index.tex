\chapter{Applications of graph rewriting}\label{chap:graphs-applications}

We can now rewrite traced string diagrams modulo \emph{traced comonoid}
structure, which can be applied to several areas across computed science.
In this chapter, we will examine how the rewriting framework can be applied to
settings with a \emph{traced Cartesian} (dataflow) structure, and to our
intended application of sequential circuits.
