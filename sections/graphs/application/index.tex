\chapter{Applications of graph rewriting}

Using the results of the previous chapters, we can rewrite traced string
diagrams modulo \emph{traced comonoid} structure, which can be applied to
several areas across computed science.
In this chapter, we will examine how it can be applied to settings with a
\emph{traced Cartesian} (dataflow) structure, and to our intended application of
sequential circuits.
