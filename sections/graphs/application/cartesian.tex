One important class of categories with a traced comonoid structure are
\emph{traced Cartesian}, or \emph{dataflow},
categories~\cite{cazanescu1990new}.
Recall from \cref{def:cartesian-category} that the tensor in a Cartesian
category is given by the category-theoretic product.
We can equivalently view this as a category in which each object is equipped
with a commutative comonoid structure in which the comonoid and counit are
\emph{natural}: morphisms can be `pushed' through them.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{fox1976coalgebras}]
    A category \(\mcc\) equipped with a commutative comonoid structure is
    Cartesian if and only if the equations in \cref{fig:cartesian-equations}
    hold for all \(\iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=f,dom=m,cod=n]\).
\end{theorem}

\input{sections/graphs/application/floats/cartesian-equations}

Sequential circuits have a natural notion of copying and discarding data, so it
makes sense that the semantic categories of circuits should be Cartesian.
In \cite{ghica2016categorical}, the equational theory is used to show that this
is the case, but with the stream semantics we have a much more elementary proof.

\begin{theorem}
    \index{streami@\(\streami\)}
    \(\streami\) is Cartesian.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The tensor in \(\streami\) is defined to be the Cartesian product.
\end{proof}

As the three semantic categories are isomorphic to \(\streami\) they are also
Cartesian.

\begin{corollary}
    \index{scircsigma@\(\scircsigmai\)}
    \index{scircsigma@\(\scircsigmaobs\)}
    \index{scircsigma@\(\scircsigmae\)}
    \(\scircsigmai\), \(\scircsigmaobs\) and \(\scircsigmae\) are Cartesian.
\end{corollary}

We can express the data of a Cartesian category as an extension of the
monoidal theory of commutative comonoids.

\begin{definition}
    The Cartesian monoidal theory \(
    (\generators[\mathbf{Cart}], \equations[\mathbf{Cart}])
    \) is defined as \(
    \generators[\mathbf{Cart}] \coloneqq \generators[\ccomon]
    \) and \(
    \equations[\mathbf{Cart}]
    \coloneqq
    \generators[\ccomon] + (\cartnatcopyeqn) + (\cartnatdisceqn)
    \) where \((\cartnatcopyeqn)\) and \((\cartnatdisceqn)\) are defined as in
    \cref{fig:cartesian-theory-equations}.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    Note that we do not need the two `coherence' Cartesian equations when
    considering monoidal theories, because they follow immediately from the
    construction of multiple-bit structures
    (\cref{not:arbitrary-width-structure}).
\end{remark}

\input{sections/graphs/application/floats/cartesian-prop}

The hypergraph interpretations of these rules are shown in
\cref{fig:cartesian-graphs}.

\begin{remark}
    The combination of Cartesian equations with the underlying compact closed
    structure of \(\cspdhyp\) may prompt alarm bells, as a compact closed
    category in which the tensor is the Cartesian product is trivial.
    However, \(\cspdhyp\) is \emph{not} subject to
    these equations: it is only a setting for performing graph
    rewrites.
\end{remark}

Using hypergraphs to reason about Cartesian categories is appealing because one
can focus on applying the two naturality equations
\((\cartnatcopyeqn)\) and \((\cartnatdisceqn)\).
As a case study, we will consider \emph{fixed point operators}; several equivalent
axiomatisations exist~\cite{hasegawa1997recursion,simpson2000complete}, but we
use the equations presented in~\cite{hasegawa2009traced}.

\begin{definition}[\cite{hasegawa2009traced}]
    \index{Conway fixed point operator}
    Let \(\mcc\) be a Cartesian category.
    A \emph{Conway fixed point operator} in \(\mcc\) is a family of functions \(
    \morph{
        (-)^{\dagger_{A,X}}
    }{
        \mcc(A \times X, X)
    }{
        \mcc(A, X)
    }
    \) drawn as \[
        \left(\iltikzfig{strings/category/f-2-1}[colour=white,box=f,dom1=X,dom2=A,cod=X]\right)
        \coloneqq
        \iltikzfig{strings/structure/cartesian/fixpoint}
    \] subject to the following equations:
    \begin{gather*}
        \iltikzfig{strings/structure/cartesian/fixpoint-lhs}
        =
        \iltikzfig{strings/structure/cartesian/fixpoint-rhs}
        \quad
        \iltikzfig{strings/structure/cartesian/diagonal-fixpoint-lhs}
        =
        \iltikzfig{strings/structure/cartesian/diagonal-fixpoint-rhs}
        \\[0.5em]
        \iltikzfig{strings/structure/cartesian/dinaturality-fixpoint-lhs}
        =
        \iltikzfig{strings/structure/cartesian/dinaturality-fixpoint-rhs}
        \\[0.5em]
        \iltikzfig{strings/structure/cartesian/naturality-fixpoint-lhs}
        =
        \iltikzfig{strings/structure/cartesian/naturality-fixpoint-rhs}
    \end{gather*}
\end{definition}

The notation we use for fixed point operators is already evocative of a trace, and
the two are indeed equivalent.
This was independently observed by Bloom and Ã‰sik \cite{bloom1993iteration},
\c{S}tef\u{a}nescu \cite{stefanescu2000network}, and Hyland, the former two before the
notion of traced monoidal categories were formalised.

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Thm.\ 3.1]{hasegawa1997recursion}, \cite{hasegawa1999models}}]
    A Cartesian category is traced if and only if it has a Conway operator.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    This can be shown by constructing one operator using the other.
    \vspace{-1em}
    \begin{gather*}
        \left(\iltikzfig{strings/category/f-2-1}[box=f,colour=white]\right)^{\dagger_{X,A}}
        =
        \iltikzfig{strings/structure/cartesian/fixpoint-from-trace}
        \qquad
        \trace{X}[A][B]{\iltikzfig{strings/category/f-2-2}[box=f,colour=white]}
        =
        \iltikzfig{strings/structure/cartesian/trace-from-fixpoint}
    \end{gather*}
    As these constructions are inverses, the conditions are equivalent.
\end{proof}

This means that we can reason about fixpoints using the same principles as
reasoning with the trace and the comonoid structure, with the addition of the
Cartesian equations.

\begin{example}[Unfolding]
    \index{unfolding}
    Reasoning about fixpoints in a traced category can be performed using the
    \emph{unfolding} rule.
    \begin{gather*}
        \iltikzfig{strings/traced/trace-rhs}[box=f,colour=white,dom=m,cod=n,trace=x]
        =
        \iltikzfig{circuits/examples/reasoning/unfolding/unfolding-1}[box=f,colour=white,dom=m,cod=n,trace=x]
        =
        \iltikzfig{circuits/examples/reasoning/unfolding/unfolding-2}[box=f,colour=white,dom=m,cod=n,trace=x]
        =
        \iltikzfig{circuits/examples/reasoning/unfolding/unfolding-3}[box=f,colour=white,dom=m,cod=n,trace=x]
    \end{gather*}
    In the syntactic setting, this requires the application of multiple
    equations: the two counitality equations followed by the copy equation and
    optionally some axioms of STMCs for housekeeping.
    If we use the hypergraph interpretation, the comonoid equations are absorbed
    into the notation so only one rule needs to be applied.

\index{cocartesian category}
\index{category!cocartesian}
\index{iteration}
The dual notion of traced \emph{cocartesian}
categories~\cite{bainbridge1976feedback} are also important in computer science:
a trace in a traced cocartesian category corresponds to \emph{iteration} in the
context of \emph{control flow}.
The details of this section could also be applied to the cocartesian case by
flipping all the directions and working with partial \emph{right}-monogamous
cospans.
