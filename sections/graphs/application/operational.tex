\section{Sequential circuits}

\index{operational semantics}
\index{semantics!operational}
When performing traced graph rewriting using hypergraphs, any wires going from
right-to-left are treated in exactly the same way as wires going from
left-to-right: as tentacles connecting source and target vertices.
In the operational semantics for sequential circuits, there are rules
that operate especially on graphs of a certain form enclosed by a trace;
while it would be sound to apply these arbitrarily (by virtue of the sliding
axioms), for a \emph{productive} procedure we need to be more guided.
We will select particular tentacles as the `chosen trace wires' (coloured red)
for global transformations.

\begin{example}\label{ex:sr-latch-interpretation}
    Recall the SR NOR latch circuit from \cref{ex:sr-latch}.
    This is interpreted as
    follows, where the \(\wedge\), \(\neg\) and \(\delta\) edges respectively
    represent the \(\orgate\) gate, \(\notgate\) gate, and delay.
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}[bezier bounding box=true,column sep=tiny]
            \iltikzfig{graphs/circuits/sr-latch/inputs}
            \arrow{r}
            &
            \iltikzfig{graphs/circuits/sr-latch/latch}
            &
            \arrow{l}
            \iltikzfig{graphs/circuits/sr-latch/outputs}
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
\end{example}

Since the transformation into global trace-delay form is through axioms
of STMCs, as hypergraphs a circuit and its trace-delay form are isomorphic.
The first rewrite that needs to be applied is the global Mealy reduction
\((\mealyeqn)\).

\begin{example}\label{ex:sr-latch-mealy-graph}
    Applying the Mealy rewrite to \cref{ex:sr-latch-interpretation} produces
    the following cospan of hypergraphs:
    \vspace{-1em}
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}[bezier bounding box=true,column sep=tiny]
            \iltikzfig{graphs/circuits/sr-latch/inputs}
            \arrow{r}
            &
            \iltikzfig{graphs/circuits/sr-latch/mealy}
            &
            \arrow{l}
            \iltikzfig{graphs/circuits/sr-latch/outputs}
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
\end{example}

The instant feedback reduction can produce a complicated term with many forks;
in the hypergraph representation, these forks are all absorbed into one.

\begin{example}\label{ex:instant-feedback-rewrite}
    Below is an example showing how the instant feedback rewrite is applied to
    a circuit in Mealy form containing one generator \(e\).
    \begin{center}
        \includestandalone{figures/graphs/circuits/unroll/rewrite}
    \end{center}
\end{example}

As the instant feedback rule eliminates non-delay-guarded feedback loops, there
are no red tentacles in the right-hand side of the rule or the rewritten graph.

\begin{example}\label{ex:sr-latch-instant-feedback-graph}
    The interpretation of the SR latch from \cref{ex:sr-latch-mealy-graph}
    after being rewritten by the instant feedback rewrite is shown below.
    \vspace{-1em}
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}[bezier bounding box=true, column sep=tiny]
            \scalebox{0.7}{\iltikzfig{graphs/circuits/sr-latch/inputs}}
            \arrow{r}
            &
            \scalebox{0.7}{\iltikzfig{graphs/circuits/sr-latch/instant-feedback}}
            &
            \arrow{l}
            \scalebox{0.7}{\iltikzfig{graphs/circuits/sr-latch/outputs}}
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
\end{example}

After performing the instant feedback rewrite, the graph is ready to receive
inputs.

\begin{example}\label{ex:sr-latch-streaming-graph}
    We apply the inputs \(\belnaptrue\belnapfalse\) to the prepared SR latch
    hypergraph from \cref{ex:sr-latch-instant-feedback-graph} by precomposing
    some value registers.
    \vspace{-1em}
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}[bezier bounding box=true, column sep=tiny]
            \scalebox{0.7}{\iltikzfig{graphs/circuits/sr-latch/inputs}}
            \arrow{r}
            &
            \scalebox{0.7}{\iltikzfig{graphs/circuits/sr-latch/applied}}
            &
            \arrow{l}
            \scalebox{0.7}{\iltikzfig{graphs/circuits/sr-latch/outputs}}
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    This graph is then rewritten by the streaming rule.
    \vspace{-2em}
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}[bezier bounding box=true, column sep=tiny]
            \scalebox{0.7}{\iltikzfig{graphs/circuits/sr-latch/inputs}}
            \arrow{r}
            &
            \scalebox{0.7}{\iltikzfig{graphs/circuits/sr-latch/streamed}}
            &
            \arrow{l}
            \scalebox{0.7}{\iltikzfig{graphs/circuits/sr-latch/outputs}}
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
\end{example}

The final step is to propagate the values using the value rules.
These have straightforward hypergraph interpretations, which are illustrated
in \cref{fig:graph-values}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \scalebox{0.8}{\includestandalone{figures/graphs/circuits/gate/rule}}
    \quad
    \raisebox{0.5em}{\scalebox{0.8}{\includestandalone{figures/graphs/circuits/fork-rewrite/rule}}}
    \\
    \scalebox{0.8}{\includestandalone{figures/graphs/circuits/join/rule}}
    \quad
    \raisebox{1em}{\scalebox{0.8}{\includestandalone{figures/graphs/circuits/stub/rule}}}
    \caption{Hypergraph interpretations of the value rules}
    \label{fig:graph-values}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}
    When applying the value rules to the streamed circuit from
    \cref{ex:sr-latch-streaming-graph}, we apply the fork rules as much as
    possible to propagate the values:
    \begin{center}
        \vspace{-1em}
        \begin{tikzcd}[bezier bounding box=true, column sep=tiny]
            \scalebox{0.7}{\iltikzfig{graphs/circuits/sr-latch/inputs}}
            \arrow{r}
            &
            \scalebox{0.7}{\iltikzfig{graphs/circuits/sr-latch/values-1}}
            &
            \arrow{l}
            \scalebox{0.7}{\iltikzfig{graphs/circuits/sr-latch/outputs}}
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    We can then repeatedly apply the gate and eliminate rule to obtain
    the outputs and next state, which can be seen below.
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}[bezier bounding box=true, column sep=tiny]
            \scalebox{0.7}{\iltikzfig{graphs/circuits/sr-latch/inputs}}
            \arrow{r}
            &
            \scalebox{0.7}{\iltikzfig{graphs/circuits/sr-latch/values-2}}
            &
            \arrow{l}
            \scalebox{0.7}{\iltikzfig{graphs/circuits/sr-latch/outputs}}
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    To identify the outputs, one simply needs to traverse from the outputs of
    the graph.
\end{example}

The initial global transformations do not have to be performed for each
time-step; for subsequent inputs one only needs to use the streaming and value
rules.

\begin{remark}
    Note that the fork rule is not left-linear as it uses the comonoid
    structure.
    Consider the term \(
    \iltikzfig{graphs/circuits/fork-rewrite/term-g}
    \); in the hypergraph interpretation it is possible to apply the fork rule
    to this term.
    \begin{gather*}
        \includestandalone{figures/graphs/circuits/fork-rewrite/fork-rewrite}
    \end{gather*}
    This reduction has arisen due to the counitality of the comonoid.
    \begin{gather*}
        \iltikzfig{graphs/circuits/fork-rewrite/term-g}
        =
        \iltikzfig{graphs/circuits/fork-rewrite/term-g-1}
        \reduction
        \iltikzfig{graphs/circuits/fork-rewrite/term-h}
    \end{gather*}
    This means that a fork rewrite is only productive if the vertex in the image
    of \(f\) has out-degree greater than \(1\).
\end{remark}
