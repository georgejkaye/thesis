\section{Traced terms}

We have now seen the classes of cospans of hypergraphs that correspond to
terms in a hypergraph category and terms in a symmetric monoidal category.
Terms in a symmetric traced monoidal category sit somewhere in the middle of
these two: cycles are permitted but wires cannot fork or join arbitrarily.
Our contribution is to characterise the cospans of hypergraphs that correspond
to traced terms by weakening the conditions of monogamy and acyclicity described
in the previous section.

\begin{definition}
    \index{tsigma@\(\stmcsigma\)}
    \nomenclature{\(\stmcsigma\)}{traced PROP of traced terms freely generated over \(\Sigma\)}
    For a set of generators \(\generators\), let \(\stmcsigma\) be the traced
    PROP freely generated over \(\generators\).
\end{definition}

First we will establish the morphism \(\stmcsigma \to \cspdhyp\) we will use
to map traced terms to cospans of hypergraphs.
We could do this manually fairly easily, but this would mean we would have to
redo all the proofs in the previous section from scratch.
Instead we will reuse the previous results, by exploiting the correspondence
between traced and compact closed categories.

\begin{lemma}[\cite{rosebrugh2005generic}, Prop.\ 2.8]
    Every hypergraph category is self-dual compact closed.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    In a hypergraph category, the cup on a given object is defined as \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/compact-closed/cup-self-dual}[colour=white,obj=A]
    \coloneqq
    \iltikzfig{strings/structure/frobenius/cup}[obj=A]
    \) and the cap as \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/compact-closed/cap-self-dual}[colour=white,obj=A]
    \coloneqq
    \iltikzfig{strings/structure/frobenius/cap}[obj=A]
    \).
    The snake equations follow by applying the Frobenius equation and unitality:
    \begin{gather*}
        \iltikzfig{strings/structure/frobenius/snake-1-0}
        =
        \iltikzfig{strings/structure/frobenius/snake-1-1}
        =
        \iltikzfig{strings/structure/frobenius/snake-1-2}
        \qquad
        \iltikzfig{strings/structure/frobenius/snake-2-0}
        =
        \iltikzfig{strings/structure/frobenius/snake-2-1}
        =
        \iltikzfig{strings/structure/frobenius/snake-2-2}
        \qedhere
    \end{gather*}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:stmc-subcat-hyp}
    \(\stmcsigma\) is a subcategory of \(\hypcsigma\).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Since \(\hypsigma\) is compact closed, it has a (canonical) trace.
    For \(\stmcsigma\) to be a subcategory of \(\hypcsigma\), every morphism
    of the former must also be a morphism on the latter.
    Since the two categories are freely generated (with the trace constructed
    through the Frobenius generators in the latter), all that remains is to
    check that every morphism in \(\stmcsigma\) is a unique morphism in
    \(\hypcsigma\), i.e.\ the equations of \(\frob\) do not merge any together.
    This is trivial since the equations do not apply to the construction of the
    canonical trace.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
    \nomenclature{\(\tracedtosymandfrobsigma\)}{inclusion functor \(\stmcsigma \to \hypcsigma\)}
    Let \(\morph{\tracedtosymandfrobsigma}{\stmcsigma}{\hypcsigma}\) be defined
    as the inclusion functor induced by \cref{lem:stmc-subcat-hyp}.
\end{definition}

\begin{corollary}
    \(\tracedtosymandfrobsigma\) is faithful.
\end{corollary}

To translate a term in \(\stmcsigma\) into a cospan of hypergraphs, one uses
the inclusion functor \(\tracedtosymandfrobsigma\) to elevate to the
Frobenius realm, before applying \(\termandfrobtohypsigma\) from the previous
section to obtain a cospan of hypergraphs.

\begin{corollary}
    \(\termandfrobtohypsigma \circ \tracedtosymandfrobsigma\) is faithful.
\end{corollary}

\subsection{Partial monogamy}

Since \(\termandfrobtohypsigma \circ \tracedtosymandfrobsigma\) is faithful,
every traced term in \(\stmcsigma\) has a unique corresponding cospan of
hypergraphs.
This functor is not clearly not full; there are more terms in
\(\hypcsigma\) than there are in \(\stmcsigma\).
The next step is to characterise the image of
\(\termandfrobtohypsigma \circ \tracedtosymandfrobsigma\).

Since monogamous acyclic cospans correspond exactly to symmetric monoidal terms,
this property is too restrictive to be used as a setting for modelling traced
terms.
Clearly, we can drop the acyclicity condition, as the trace can introduce
cycles.
However, there is also a foible that arises with the monogamicity condition:
although wires are also not permitted to arbitrarily fork or join in a traced
category, it is possible to have a case where wires do not connect to
any generators while also remaining disconnected from the interfaces.
This special case is the trace of the identity, which in string diagrams is
depicted as a closed
loop \(
\trace{1}{\iltikzfig{strings/category/identity}[colour=white]}
=
\iltikzfig{strings/traced/trace-id}
\).

\begin{remark}
    One might think a closed loop can be discarded, i.e.\ \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/traced/trace-id}
    =
    \iltikzfig{strings/monoidal/empty}
    \), but this is \emph{not} always the case, such as in
    \(\finvectk{k}\)~\cite[Sec.\ 6.1]{hasegawa1997recursion}.
\end{remark}

These closed loops can be modelled as vertices disconnected from either
interface.

\begin{definition}[Partial monogamy]
    \index{partial monogamy}
    \index{monogamy!partial}
    \index{cospan!partial monogamous}
    For a cospan \(\cospan{m}[f]{F}[g]{n}\) in
    \(\cspdhyp\), let \(\mathsf{in}(F)\) be defined as the image of \(f\) and
    let \(\mathsf{out}(F)\) be defined as the image of \(g\).
    A cospan \(\cospan{m}[f]{F}[g]{n} \in \cspdhyp\) is
    \emph{partial monogamous} if \(f\) and \(g\) are mono and, for all vertices
    \(v\), the degree of \(v\) is
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{rlcrl}
            \((0,0)\)
             &
            if \(v \in \mathsf{in}(F) \wedge v \in \mathsf{out}(F)\)
             &
            \quad
             &
            \((0,1)\)
             &
            if \(v \in \mathsf{in}(F)\)
            \\
            \((1,0)\)
             &
            if \(v \in \mathsf{out}(F)\)
             &
            \quad
             &
            \((0,0)\)
            or \((1,1)\)
             &
            otherwise
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}\label{ex:partial-monogamous}
    The following cospans of hypergraphs are partial monogamous:
    \[
        \iltikzfig{graphs/partial-monogamy/yes-0}
        \quad
        \iltikzfig{graphs/partial-monogamy/yes-1}
    \]
    The following cospans of hypergraphs are not partial monogamous:
    \[
        \iltikzfig{graphs/partial-monogamy/no-0}
        \quad
        \iltikzfig{graphs/partial-monogamy/no-1}
    \]
\end{example}

To use partial monogamous cospans as a setting for interpreting traced terms,
they must be assembled into a sub-PROP of \(\cspdhyp\).

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:identities-symmetries-partial-monogamous}
    Identities and symmetries are partial monogamous.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Identities and symmetries are monogamous by
    \cref{lem:identities-symmetries-monogamous} so they must also be partial
    monogamous.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:partial-monogamicity-preserved-composition}
    Partial monogamy is preserved by composition.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    By \cref{lem:monogamicity-preserved-composition}, composition preserves
    monogamicity.
    The only difference between partial monogamous cospans and monogamous ones
    is that the former may have cycles and vertices of degree \((0,0)\) not in the
    interfaces.
    However, since neither of these can be interfaces they cannot be altered by
    composition, so partial monogamy must also be preserved.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:partial-monogamicity-preserved-tensor}
    Partial monogamy is preserved by tensor.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Tensor preserves monogamicity by
    \cref{lem:monogamicity-preserved-tensor}, and as tensor does not affect the
    degree of vertices then it preserves partial monogamy as well.
\end{proof}

As partial monogamicity is preserved by both forms of composition, the
partial monogamous cospans themselves form a PROP.

\begin{definition}
    \index{pmcspdhyp@\(\pmcspdhyp\)}
    \nomenclature{\(\pmcspdhyp\)}{PROP of partial monogamous cospans of hypergraphs}
    Let \(\pmcspdhyp\) be the sub-PROP of \(\cspdhyp\) containing only the
    partial monogamous cospans of hypergraphs.
\end{definition}

We must show that \(\pmcspdhyp\) is also traced, by making sure the canonical
trace does not create cospans that are not partial monogamous.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:partial-monogamous-trace}
    The canonical trace is a trace on \(\pmcspdhyp\).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Consider a partial monogamous cospan \(
    \cospan{x + m}[f + h]{F}[g + k]{x + n}
    \); we must show that its trace \(
    \cospan{m}[h]{F^\prime}[k]{n}
    \) is partial monogamous.
    For each vertex \(a \in x\), \(f(a)\) and \(g(a)\) are merged together in the
    traced graph, summing their degrees.
    If a vertex is in the image of \(h\) or \(k\), this is also the case in the
    traced cospan.
    We consider the various cases:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item if \(f(a) = g(a)\), then this vertex must have degree \((0, 0)\);
              the traced vertex will still have degree \((0, 0)\) and will no
              longer be in the interface;
        \item if \(f(a)\) is also in the image of \(n \to F\) and \(g(i)\) is
              also in the image of \(m \to F\), then both \(f(a)\) and
              \(g(a)\) have degree \((0, 0)\); the traced vertex will still
              have degree \((0, 0)\) and be in both interfaces of the traced
              cospan;
        \item if \(f(a)\) is in the image of \(n \to F\), then \(f(i)\)
              has \((0, 0)\) and \(g(a)\) has degree
              \((1,0)\), so the traced vertex has degree \((1, 0)\) and
              is in the image of \(n \to F^\prime\);
        \item if \(g(i)\) is in the image of \(m \to F\), then the above
              applies in reverse; and
        \item if neither vertex is in the image of \(m \to F\) and \(n \to F\),
              then the traced vertex will have degree \((1,1)\) and be in the
              image of no interface.
    \end{itemize}
    In all these cases, partial monogamy is preserved.
\end{proof}

Crucially, while we leave \(\pmcspdhyp\) in order to construct the trace using
the cup and cap, the resulting cospan \emph{is} in \(\pmcspdhyp\).

\subsection{The traced correspondence}

Now that we have a traced sub-PROP of cospans of hypergraphs, it is time to show
that this particular sub-PROP is the one that corresponds to traced terms.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:termtohyp-image}
    A cospan \(\cospan{m}{F}{n}\) is in the image of \(
    \termandfrobtohypsigma \circ \tracedtosymandfrobsigma\) if
    and only if it is partial monogamous.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    For the \(\onlyifdir\) direction, the generators of \(\stmcsigma\) are mapped to
    monogamous cospans by \(
    \termandfrobtohypsigma \circ \tracedtosymandfrobsigma
    \), and partial monogamy is preserved by composition
    (\cref{lem:partial-monogamicity-preserved-composition}),
    tensor (\cref{lem:partial-monogamicity-preserved-tensor}),
    and trace
    (\cref{thm:partial-monogamous-trace}).

    For the \(\ifdir\) direction, we show that any partial monogamous cospan \(
    \cospan{m}[f]{F}[g]{n}
    \) is in the image of \(
    \termandfrobtohypsigma \circ \tracedtosymandfrobsigma
    \) by constructing an isomorphic trace of cospans, in which
    each component under the trace is in the image of \(\termtohypsigma\).
    The components of the new cospan are as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item let \(L\) be the discrete hypergraph containing vertices with
              degree
              \((0,0)\) that are not in the image of \(f\) or \(g\);
        \item let \(E\) be the hypergraph containing hyperedges of \(F\)
              disconnected from each other along with their source and target
              vertices;
        \item let \(V\) be the discrete hypergraph containing all the
              vertices of \(F\); and
        \item let \(S\) and \(T\) be the discrete hypergraphs containing
              the source and target vertices of hyperedges in \(F\)
              respectively, with the ordering determined by some order
              \(e_1,e_2,\cdots,e_n\) on the edges in \(F\).
    \end{itemize}
    These parts can be composed to form the following composite:
    \begin{gather*}
        \cospan{L + T + m}[\id + \id + f]{L + V}[\id + \id + g]{L + S + n}
        \,\seq\,
        \cospan{L + S + n}[\id]{L + E + n}[\id]{L + T + n}
    \end{gather*}
    We take the trace of \(L + T\) over this composite to obtain a
    cospan isomorphic to the original.
    The components of the composite under the trace are all monogamous acyclic
    so are in the image of \(\termtohypsigma\) by
    \cref{thm:monogamous-acyclic-full}; this means there is a term
    \(f \in \smcsigma\) such that \(\termtohypsigma[f]\) is isomorphic to the
    original composite.
    The trace of \(f\) is in \(\stmcsigma\), so the trace of the composite is in
    the image of
    \(\termandfrobtohypsigma \circ \tracedtosymandfrobsigma\).
\end{proof}

As with the Frobenius case
(\cref{thm:isomorphism-smcfrob-cospans}), the large composite cospan may seem
confusing.
We stack up the edges in the cospan
\(\cospan{\tilde{m}}{\tilde{E}}{\tilde{n}}\), but now join up the connections
by tracing the targets of the edges around, and shuffling them to the correct
source.
The graph \(L\) contains any identity loops.

\begin{example}\label{ex:trace-composite}
    Consider the following term and its cospan interpretation:
    \begin{center}
        \iltikzfig{graphs/trace/correspondence/original-term}
        \quad
        \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=tiny]
            \iltikzfig{graphs/trace/correspondence/inputs}
            \arrow{r}
            &
            \iltikzfig{graphs/trace/correspondence/example}
            &
            \arrow{l}
            \iltikzfig{graphs/trace/correspondence/outputs}
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    We assemble the latter into the composite cospan of
    \cref{thm:termtohyp-image} as shown in \cref{fig:trace-composite}.
    Both of the components under the trace correspond to terms in \(\smcsigma\),
    so applying the trace to this produces a term in \(\stmcsigma\) which is
    equal to the original by string diagrammatic deformations.
    \begin{center}
        \iltikzfig{graphs/trace/correspondence/term}
    \end{center}
\end{example}

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

This shows that \(
\termandfrobtohypsigma \circ \tracedtosymandfrobsigma
\) is a \emph{full} mapping from \(\stmcsigma\) to \(\pmcspdchyp\).
As it is both full and faithful, we have that there is an isomorphism
between the category of terms and the category of cospans of partial
monogamous hypergraphs.

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:stmc-graph-iso}
    \(\stmc{\Sigma} \cong \pmcspdhyp\).
\end{corollary}

This means that \(\pmcspdchyp\) is a suitable setting for interpreting terms in
\(\stmcsigma\): every term has a corresponding cospan of hypergraphs, and
every cospan has a corresponding term.

\begin{example}
    The partial monogamous cospans from \cref{ex:partial-monogamous} are shown
    below with their corresponding terms in \(\stmcsigma\).
    \[
        \iltikzfig{graphs/partial-monogamy/yes-0}

        \quad
        \iltikzfig{graphs/terms/term-1}
    \]
\end{example}

\subsection{Traced coloured terms}

The results above all also hold for the coloured case by following the same
strategy but with the appropriate coloured PROPs.

\begin{definition}
    \index{tsigmac@\(\stmcsigmac\)}
    \nomenclature{\(\stmcsigmac\)}{traced \(C\)-coloured PROP of traced terms freely generated over \(\Sigma\)}
    For a countable set of colours \(C\) and a set of generators \(\generators\),
    let \(\stmcsigmac\) be the traced \(C\)-coloured PROP freely generated over
    \(\generators\).
\end{definition}


\begin{lemma}\label{lem:stmc-subcat-hypc}
    \(\stmcsigmac\) is a subcategory of \(\hypcsigmac\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}
    \nomenclature{\(\tracedtosymandfrobsigma\)}{inclusion functor \(\stmcsigmac \to \hypcsigmac\)}
    Let \(\morph{\tracedtosymandfrobsigmac}{\stmcsigmac}{\hypcsigmac}\) be the
    inclusion functor induced by \cref{lem:stmc-subcat-hypc}.
\end{definition}

\begin{corollary}
    \(\tracedtosymandfrobsigmac\) is faithful.
\end{corollary}

The partial monogamy condition works the same for coloured cospans, so
the partial monogamous cospans of coloured hypergraphs form a traced coloured
category.

\begin{definition}
    Let \(\pmcspdchyp\) be the sub-PROP of \(\cspdchyp\) containing only the
    partial monogamous cospans of hypergraphs.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    The canonical trace is a trace on \(\pmcspdchyp\).
\end{theorem}

The fullness proof then proceeds as before.

\begin{theorem}
    A cospan is in the image of
    \(\termandfrobtohypsigmac \circ \tracedtosymandfrobsigmac\) if and only if
    it is partial monogamous.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
    \(\stmcsigmac \cong \pmcspdchyp\).
\end{corollary}
