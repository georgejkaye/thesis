\chapter{String diagrams as hypergraphs}\label{chap:hypergraphs}

String diagrams are an appealing way of reasoning with pen and paper: they bring
intuition to one-dimensional text strings and can often shed light on the
next step of a proof.
Unfortunately, they do have drawbacks: they take up a lot of time and space, and
if not drawn with care can end up being messy, removing any benefit of using
them in the first place.

Instead it is desirable to perform reasoning with string diagrams
\emph{computationally}.
This presents some questions: how can we encode circuits constructed
categorically in such a way that a computer can understand them?
Perhaps we could input terms using traditional one-dimensional text
representations?
Text is something that computers are very good at processing, but as we have
already established it is verbose, unintuitive, and, most importantly,
means we have to apply the axioms of STMCs explicitly.
Sticking to string diagrams would be ideal, but the representation
needs some thought.
Although computers do not deal well with topological objects like string
diagrams, they are very well acquainted with combinatorial objects; for
a computer to reason effectively with string diagrams, they must first be
interpreted as \emph{graphs}.
