\chapter{String diagrams as hypergraphs}

String diagrams are an appealing way of reasoning with pen and paper: they bring
intuition to confusing one-dimensional text strings, can often shed light on the
next step of a proof, and most importantly, they look very pretty.
Unfortunately, they do have drawbacks: they take up a lot of time and space, and
if one is not careful the scribbles on a whiteboard might all start to merge
into one, resulting in a mess worse than the original term representation.

Instead it is desirable to perform reasoning with string diagrams
\emph{computationally}.
Although computers do not deal well with topological objects like string
diagrams `as is', they are very well acquainted with combinatorial objects: for
a computer to reason effectively with string diagrams, they must first be
interpreted as \emph{graphs}.
