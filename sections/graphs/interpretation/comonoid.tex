    \label{fig:graph-roadmap}
\end{figure}

By characterising the cospans of hypergraphs that correspond to \emph{traced}
terms, we already have a setting in which we can model sequential circuit
morphisms combinatorially.
But why stop there?
When modelling \emph{Frobenius} terms, we were modelling them modulo the
Frobenius \emph{equations}; the comonoid and monoid structures merge
together so we do not need to consider the equations of associativity,
commutativity or unitality.

In the realm of sequential circuits we also have monoid and comonoid structures,
but instead of forming a Frobenius structure they only form a \emph{bialgebra}.
The equations of a bialgebra are different to those of a Frobenius algebra in
how the monoid and comonoid interact.
Compare the two Frobenius equations with the bialgebra equation shown below:
\[
    \iltikzfig{strings/structure/bialgebra/merge-copy-lhs}
    =
    \iltikzfig{strings/structure/frobenius/frobenius-l}
    \quad
    \iltikzfig{strings/structure/bialgebra/merge-copy-lhs}
    =
    \iltikzfig{strings/structure/frobenius/frobenius-r}
    \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad
    \iltikzfig{strings/structure/bialgebra/merge-copy-lhs}
    =
    \iltikzfig{strings/structure/bialgebra/merge-copy-rhs}
\]
It is possible to derive the equation on the right from the ones on the left,
but the reverse is not the case: one cannot derive the two Frobenius equations
just with the bialgebra equation.
A Frobenius structure implies a bialgebra structure, but a bialgebra structure
does \emph{not} imply a Frobenius structure.

As the category \(\cspdchyp\) contains a Frobenius structure by nature of being
a hypergraph category, this means that it is unsuitable for modelling settings
with just a bialgebra setting, as too many terms would map to the same
cospan of hypergraphs.

\todo[inline]{Show cospans of frobenius equations}

But we should not let that get us down too much!
Since the issue only arises with the interactions between the monoid and the
comonoid, we can use cospans of hypergraphs to reason modulo the equations of
just one of the two structures.
This means that not all of the equations of a bialgebra will be absorbed into
the combinatorial structure, but this is better than too many taking effect!

\begin{remark}
    Alas, we cannot claim to have pioneered the idea of studying terms with just
    a monoid or comonoid structure, and there has been some work
    into the cospans of hypergraphs which correspond to such
    terms~\cite{fritz2023free,milosavljevic2023string}.
    What we bring to the table is studying how such terms interact with the
    \emph{trace}; does removing acyclicity lead to any degeneracies?
\end{remark}

In the case of sequential circuits, it makes sense to focus on the comonoid
structure, as forking wires is far more of a natural concept than joining them.
To characterise categories of terms with a comonoid structure, we must first
define the monoidal theory of commutative comonoids.

\begin{definition}
    Let \((\generators[\ccomon], \equations[\ccomon])\) be the symmetric
    monoidal theory of \emph{commutative comonoids}, with \(
        \Sigma_\ccomon \coloneqq \{
            \iltikzfig{strings/structure/comonoid/copy}[colour=white],
            \iltikzfig{strings/structure/comonoid/discard}[colour=white]
        \}
    \) and \(\mce_\ccomon\) defined as in \cref{fig:comonoid-equations}.
    We write \(
        \ccomon \coloneqq \smc{\generators[\ccomon], \equations[\ccomon]}
    \).
\end{definition}

\input{sections/graphs/interpretation/floats/comonoid-equations}

From now on, we write `comonoid' to mean `commutative comonoid'.

When identifying the cospans of hypergraphs that correspond to terms with traced
comonoid structure, the notion of monogamy will once again need to be modified.
Partial monogamy is now too strong, as we now actually want wires to fork!
However, weakening to no monogamy at all is too much, as we only want wires to
fork but not join.
Effectively, we want vertices to be `monogamous on one side'.

\begin{definition}[Partial left-monogamy]
    For a cospan \(\cospan{m}[f]{H}[g]{n}\), we say it is
    \emph{partial left-monogamous} if \(f\) is mono and, for all nodes
    \(v \in H_\star\), the degree of \(v\) is \((0,m)\) if \(v \in f_\star\) and
    \((0,m)\) or \((1,m)\) otherwise, for some \(m \in \nat\).
\end{definition}

Partial left-monogamy is a weakening of partial monogamy that allows vertices
to have multiple `out' connections, which represent the use of the comonoid
structure to fork wires; vertices must still only have one `in' connection.

        }_{\text{not partial left-monogamous}}

\end{figure}

\begin{example}
    Examples of cospans that are and are not partial left-monogamous are shown
    in \cref{fig:partial-left-monogamous-examples}.
\end{example}

\begin{remark}
    As with the vertices not in the interfaces with degree \((0, 0)\) in the
    vanilla traced case, the vertices not in the interface with degree
    \((0, m)\) allow for the interpretation of terms such as \(
        \trace{}{\iltikzfig{strings/structure/comonoid/copy}[colour=white]}
    \).
    \todo[inline]{Draw the cospan}
\end{remark}

As we are used at this point, we must ensure that partial left-monogamy is
preserved by the categorical operations, so partial left-monogamous cospans
form a PROP.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:partial-monogamous-id-sym}
    Identities and symmetries are partial left-monogamous.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Again by \cref{lem:identities-symmetries-monogamous}, identities and
    symmetries are monogamous so they are also partial left-monogamous.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    Given partial left-monogamous cospans
    \(\cospan{m}{F}{n}\) and
    \(\cospan{n}{G}{p}\), the composition \(
        (\cospan{m}{F}{n})
        \seq
        (\cospan{n}{G}{p})
    \) is partial left-monogamous.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    We only need to check the in-degree of vertices, as the out-degree can be
    arbitrary.
    Only the vertices in the image of \(n \to G\) have their in-degree modified;
    they will gain the in-tentacles of the corresponding vertices in the image
    of \(n \to F\).
    Initially the vertices in \(n \to G\) must have in-degree \(0\) by partial
    monogamy.
    They can only gain at most one in-tentacle from vertices in \(n \to F\)
    as each of these vertices has in-degree \(0\) or \(1\) and \(n \to G\) is
    mono.
    So the composite graph is partial left-monogamous.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    Given partial left-monogamous cospans \(\cospan{m}{F}{n}\)
    and \(\cospan{p}{G}{q}\), the tensor \(
        (\cospan{m}{F}{n})
        \tensor
        (\cospan{n}{G}{p})
    \) is partial left-monogamous.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    The elements of the original graphs are unaffected so
    the degrees are unchanged.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
    Let \(\plmcspdchyp\) be the sub-PROP of \(\cspdchyp\) containing only the
    partial left-monogamous cospans of hypergraphs.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    The canonical trace is a trace on \(\plmcspdchyp\).
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    We must show that for any set of vertices in the image
    of \(x + n \to K\) merged by the canonical trace, at most one of them can
    have in-degree \(1\).
    But this must be the case because any image in the image of
    \(x + m \to K\) must have in-degree \(0\), and \(x + m \to K\) is
    moreover mono so it cannot merge vertices in the image of
    \(x + n \to K\).
\end{proof}

This category can be equipped with a comonoid structure.

\begin{definition}
    Let \(
        \morph{
            \comonoidtofrob
        }{
            \ccomon
        }{
            \frob
        }
    \) be the obvious embedding of \(\ccomon\) into \(\frob\), and let \(
        \morph{
            \tracedandcomonoidtofrob{\Sigma}
        }{
            \stmc{\Sigma} + \comon
        }{
            \smc{\Sigma} + \frob
        }
    \) be the copairing of \(\tracedtosymandfrob{\Sigma}\) and
    \(\comonoidtofrob\).
\end{definition}

As before, these PROP morphisms are summarised in \cref{fig:roadmap}.
To show that partial left-monogamy is the correct notion to characterise terms
in a traced comonoid setting, it is necessary to ensure that the image of these
PROP morphisms lands in \(\plmcspdhyp\).

\begin{lemma}
    The image of \(\frobtohyp{\Sigma} \circ \comonoidtofrob\) is in
    \(\plmcspdhyp\).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    By definition.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
    The image of \(
        \termandfrobtohypsigma \circ \tracedandcomonoidtofrob{\Sigma}
    \) is in \(\plmcspdhyp\).
\end{corollary}

To show the correspondence between \(\stmcsigma + \ccomon\) and
\(\plmcspdhyp\), we use a similar strategy to \cref{thm:termtohyp-image}.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:discrete-mono}
    Given a discrete hypergraph \(X \in \hypsigma\), any cospan
    \(\cospan{m}[f]{X}{n}\) with \(f\) mono is in the image of
    \(\frobtohypsigma \circ \comonoidtofrob\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:comonoid-fully-complete}
    \(\stmcsigma + \ccomon \cong \plmcspdhyp\).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Since \(\termandfrobtohypsigma\) and \(\comonoidtohypsigma\) are faithful,
    it suffices to show that a cospan \(\cospan{m}{F}{n}\) in
    \(\plmcspdhyp\) can be decomposed into a traced cospan in which every
    component under the trace is in the image of either
    \(\termandfrobtohypsigmac\) or \(\frobtohypsigmac \circ \comonoidtofrobc\).
    This is achieved by taking the construction of \cref{thm:termtohyp-image}
    and allowing the first component to be partial left-monogamous; by
    \cref{lem:discrete-mono} this is in the image of
    \(\frobtohypsigma \circ \comonoidtofrob\).
    The remaining components remain in the image of \(\termtohypsigma\).
    Subsequently, the entire traced cospan must be in the image of \(
        \termandfrobtohypsigma \circ [\tracedtosymandfrob, \comonoidtofrob].
    \).
\end{proof}
