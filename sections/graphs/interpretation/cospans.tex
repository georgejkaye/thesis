\subsection{Cospans of hypergraphs}

String diagrams also have \emph{input} and \emph{output} interfaces.
(Labelled) hypergraphs may have suggestively dangling nodes in the pictures,
but this is not actually encoded in the definition; moreover we may wish to
set a non-dangling node as an input or output.
To set the interfaces of a hypergraph, hypergraph homomorphisms are used
to `pick' the appropriate nodes.

\begin{definition}[Cospan]
    A \emph{cospan} is a pair of morphisms \(X \to A\)
    and \(X \to B\), written \(\cospan{X}{A}{Y}\).
    A \emph{cospan morphism} \(
    (\cospan{X}[f]{A}[g]{Y}) \to (\cospan{X}[h]{B}[k]{Y})
    \) is a morphism \(\morph{\alpha}{A}{B}\) such that the following diagram
    commutes:
    %
    \begin{center}
        \includestandalone{figures/category/diagrams/cospan-morphism}
    \end{center}
    %
    Two cospans \(\cospan{X}{A}{Y}\) and \(\cospan{X}{B}{Y}\) are
    \emph{isomorphic} if there exists a morphism of cospans as above where
    \(\alpha\) is an isomorphism.
\end{definition}

Cospans wll be used to model interfaced hypergraphs; for a cospan
\(\cospan{X}{A}{Y}\) the `apex' \(A\) will be a hypergraph and the `legs`
\(X \to A\) and \(Y \to A\) are input and output maps respectively.
Since we will be comparing interfaced hypergraphs with string diagram terms,
we require a categorical setting in which the objects are
\emph{cospans} of hypergraphs, so they must be composable.

\begin{definition}[Composition of cospans]
    \label{def:cospan-composition}
    In a category \(\mcc\) with pushouts, the composition of cospans
    \(\cospan{X}[f]{A}[g]{Y}\) and \(\cospan{Y}[h]{B}[k]{Z}\) is a cospan
    \(\cospan{X}{D}{Y}\) where \(D\) is computed by pushout:
    \begin{center}
        \includestandalone{figures/category/diagrams/cospan-composition}
    \end{center}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Categories of cospans]
    Let \(\mcc\) be a category with finite colimits.
    The category of cospans over \(\mcc\), denoted \(\csp{\mcc}\),
    has as objects the objects of \(\mcc\) and as morphisms \(A \to B\)
    the isomorphism classes of cospans \(\cospan{A}{X}{B}\) for some
    \(X \in \mcc\).
    Composition is by pushout as detailed in \cref{def:cospan-composition} and
    the identity is \(X \xrightarrow{\id[X]} X \xleftarrow{\id[X]} X\).
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
    For a category \(\mcc\) with finite colimits,
    \(\csp{\mcc}\) is symmetric monoidal with the tensor given by the
    coproduct in \(\mcc\), the monoidal unit given by the initial object
    \(0 \in \mcc\), and the symmetry defined as the cospan
    \(\cospan{A+B}{A+B}{B+A}\).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    It is a simple exercise to check that the equations of SMCs hold.
\end{proof}

As mentioned above, the legs of the cospan will act as the interfaces of the
hypergraph: the hypergraph homomorphisms from the legs to the apex will pick out
the input and output.
But this means that not every hypergraph can act as an interface to a
hypergraph, as any edges in the hypergraphs would also need to be mapped
somewhere.
We must restrict the interface hypergraphs to those that contain only vertices.

\begin{definition}[Discrete hypergraph]
    A \emph{discrete hypergraph} is a hypergraph in which each edge set is
    empty.
\end{definition}

The legs of cospans representing interfaced hypergraphs will be discrete
hypergraphs; if a hypergraph \(F\) has \(m\) inputs then the input hypergraph
\(A\) will contain \(m\) vertices.
This is not enough to fully specify the interfaces, as there must also be a
notion of \emph{order}.
We need a way of specifying which vertex corresponds to which numbered input or
output; this is formally performed by another functor.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{bonchi2022string}, Thm.\ 3.6]\label{thm:csp-construction}
    Let \(\mathbb{X}\) be a PROP in which the monoidal product is a coproduct,
    let \(\mcc\) be a category with finite colimits, and
    let \(\morph{F}{\mathbb{X}}{\mcc}\) a coproduct-preserving functor.
    Then there exists a PROP \(\csp[F]{\mcc}\) whose arrows
    \(\listvar{m} \to \listvar{n}\) are isomorphism classes of \(\mcc\)
    cospans \(\cospan{Fn}{C}{Fn}\).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Composition is given by pushout.
    \(F\) preserves coproducts so \(F(m+p) \cong Fm + Fp\) and
    \(F(n+q) \cong Fn + Fq\); subsequently the coproduct of
    \(\cospan{Fm}{C}{Fn}\) and \(\cospan{Fp}{C}{Fq}\) is given by \(
    \cospan{Fm + Fp}{C + D}{Fp + Fq}
    \).
    Symmetries in \(\mathbb{X}\) are determined by the universal property of
    the coproduct; they are inherited by \(\csp[F]{\mcc}\) because \(F\)
    preserves coproducts.
\end{proof}

\(F\) is the functor that will be used to the objects in the cospan legs with
some notion of ordering.
For our purpose, the domain of this functor will be the PROP of finite sets
\(\{0,1,2,\dots,m-1\}\).

\begin{definition}
    Let \(\finsetprop\) be the PROP with morphisms \(m \to n\) the functions
    between finite sets \([m] \to [n]\).
\end{definition}

We can now state the functor used to assemble interfaces of hypergraphs into
words.

\begin{definition}
    Let \(\morph{D}{\finsetprop}{\hypsigma}\) be defined as the functor sending
    an object \(n\) to the discrete hypergraphs with \(n\) vertices, and sending
    a function \(m \to n\) to the induced homomorphism of discrete
    hypergraphs.
\end{definition}

Instantiating \cref{thm:csp-construction} with \(D\) produces the category of
interfaced hypergraphs.

\begin{corollary}
    There is a PROP \(\cspdhyp\) where the morphisms are isomorphism classes of
    interfaced hypergraphs.
\end{corollary}

\begin{example}
    Recall the labelled hypergraph \(F\) from \cref{ex:labelled-hypergraph}.
    We assign interfaces to it as the cospan \(\cospan{3}[f]{F}[g]{3}\), where
    \begin{gather*}
        f(D0) = v_0 \quad f(D1) = v_1 \\
        g(D0) = v_4 \quad g(D1) = v_5 \quad g(D2) = v_2
    \end{gather*}
    Interfaces are drawn on the left and right of a main graph, with numbers
    illustrating the action of the cospan maps.
    \[
        \iltikzfig{graphs/example-interfaces-2}
    \]
    For clarity, we number the outputs after the inputs, but this does not
    reflect the mapping performed by \(D\).
    Composition in \(\cspdhyp\) is by pushout; effectively the vertices in the
    output of the first cospan are `glued together' with the inputs of the
    second.
    \begin{gather*}
        \iltikzfig{graphs/example-interfaces-2}
        \seq
        \iltikzfig{graphs/example-2-interfaces}
        =\\[1em]
        \iltikzfig{graphs/example-composition-2}
    \end{gather*}
    Tensor in \(\cspdhyp\) is by direct product; putting cospans on top of each
    other.
    \begin{gather*}
        \iltikzfig{graphs/example-interfaces-2}
        \tensor
        \iltikzfig{graphs/example-2-interfaces}
        =\\[1em]
        \iltikzfig{graphs/example-tensor-2}
    \end{gather*}
\end{example}

\subsection{Coloured cospans}

In the coloured setting there is slightly more nuance as the legs of the
cospans are not just numbers but \emph{words} of colours in some countable set
\(\colours\).

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:coloured-csp-construction}
    Let \(\mathbb{X}\) be a coloured PROP whose monoidal product is a coproduct,
    \(\mcc\) a category with finite colimits, and \(
    \morph{F}{\mathbb{X}}{\mcc}
    \) a coproduct-preserving functor.
    Then there exists a coloured PROP \(\csp[F]{\mcc}\) whose arrows
    \(\listvar{m} \to \listvar{n}\) are isomorphism classes of \(\mcc\)
    cospans \(\cospan{F\listvar{m}}{C}{F\listvar{n}}\).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    As \cref{thm:csp-construction} but with word concatenation rather
    than addition.
\end{proof}

It only remains to determine exactly what the functor \(F\) should be.
In \cite{bonchi2022string}, objects \([m] \in \finsetprop\) are be coloured over
some finite set of colours \(\mcc\) using a morphism \([m] \to \mcc\).
Since we are working with potentially countably infinite sets of colours, the
definition of \(\finsetprop\) must first be tweaked.

\begin{definition}
    Let \(\finsetpropwithnat\) be the category \(\finsetprop\) augmented with the
    set of natural numbers and the functions \([m] \to \nat\) for each finite
    set \([m]\).
\end{definition}

Adding in morphisms \([m] \to \nat\) allows for colourings with countably
infinite sets of colours; the PROP of finite sets \emph{coloured} over some
countable set \(C\) is the slice \(\finsetpropwithnat \slice C\).
Objects of this category are pairs \(([m], \morph{w}{[m]}{C})\); this pair can
be viewed as a word in \(\freemon{C}\) of length \(m\), with the \(i\)th letter
as \(w(i)\).

\begin{remark}
    Note that we do not include the morphisms \(\nat \to [m]\) in
    \(\finsetpropwithnat\); this is because when we view objects of
    \(\finsetpropwithnat \slice C\) as words in \(\freemon{C}\), we still only
    want to consider finite words despite there being potentially countably
    infinite colours.
\end{remark}

All that remains is to verify that \(\finsetpropwithnat \slice C\) is indeed a
coloured PROP.
To assist in this endeavour, we recall a property of slice categories.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:slice-coproducts}
    For a category \(\mcc\) with coproducts, \(\mcc \slice X\) has coproducts.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let \(A,B,X\) be objects in \(\mcc\); as \(\mcc\) has coproducts \(A + B\)
    is also an object in \(\mcc\).
    Then the coproduct of \((A, A \to X)\) and \((B, B \to X)\) in
    \(\mcc \slice X\) is \(A + B \to X\); the universal morphism is \([f, g]\).
\end{proof}

Following the strategy of \cite[Prop.\ 2.23]{bonchi2022string}, we now show
that \(\finsetpropwithnat \slice C\) is a coloured PROP.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:hatfinsetprop-slice-is-coloured-prop}
    For a countable set \(C\), \(\finsetpropwithnat \slice C\) is a
    coloured PROP.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    As established, the objects of \(\finsetpropwithnat \slice C\) can be viewed
    as words in \(\freemon{C}\).
    As slice categories preserve coproducts by \cref{lem:slice-coproducts},
    \(\finsetpropwithnat \slice C\) is strict symmetric monoidal, and the
    coproduct acts as concatenation of words.
\end{proof}

The category of interfaced coloured hypergraphs is then constructed in the same
way as the monochromatic version.

\begin{definition}[\cite{bonchi2022string}, Rem.\ 3.12]
    Let \(\morph{\pickinterfacesc{C}}{\finsetpropwithnat \slice C}{\hypsigmac}\)
    be defined as functor sending a word \(\overline{n}\) to the corresponding
    discrete coloured hypergraph containing vertices coloured as in
    \(\overline{n}\), and sending a function \(\overline{m} \to \overline{n}\)
    to the induced homomorphism of discrete hypergraphs.
\end{definition}

As with the monochromatic case, applying \cref{thm:coloured-csp-construction} to
this functor gives us a category of \emph{coloured} interfaced hypergraphs
\(\cspdchyp\).

\begin{example}
    Composition in \(\cspdchyp\) is as in \(\cspdhyp\) but now the glueing
    must also preserve colours.
    \begin{gather*}
        \iltikzfig{graphs/example-interfaces-coloured-2}
        \seq
        \iltikzfig{graphs/example-2-interfaces-coloured}
        =\\[1em]
        \iltikzfig{graphs/example-composition-coloured-2}
    \end{gather*}
    The tensor is exactly the same as in \(\cspdhyp\).
    \begin{gather*}
        \iltikzfig{graphs/example-interfaces-coloured-2}
        \tensor
        \iltikzfig{graphs/example-2-interfaces-coloured}
        =\\[1em]
        \iltikzfig{graphs/example-tensor-coloured-2}
    \end{gather*}
\end{example}
