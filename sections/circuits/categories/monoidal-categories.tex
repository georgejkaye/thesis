\section{Monoidal categories}

We will now apply the concepts of functors and natural transformations in order
to interpret \emph{parallel} composition \(\tensor\).
To do this, we use a special kind of functor known as a \emph{bifunctor}.

\begin{definition}[Bifunctor]
    A \emph{bifunctor} is a functor with a product category as its domain, i.e.\
    a functor of the form \(\mcc \times \mcd \to \mce\).
\end{definition}

The notation for functor boxes can be extended in order to show how bifunctors
map from two categories into one.
\[
    \iltikzfig{strings/category/functors/bif}[box1=f,box2=g,dom1=A,dom2=C,cod1=B,cod2=D,colour=white,functor=F]
\]
This notation suggests that a bifunctor is exactly what we need to model
parallel composition!

\begin{definition}[Monoidal category]
    \label{def:monoidal-category}
    A \emph{monoidal category} is a category \(\mcc\) equipped with a
    bifunctor \(\morph{{-} \tensor {=}}{\mcc \times \mcc}{\mcc}\) called the
    \emph{tensor product} and an additional object \(I\) called the
    \emph{monoidal unit},
    along with natural isomorphisms
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(
            \associator{A}{B}{C}
            \colon
            A \tensor (B \tensor C)
            \cong
            (A \tensor B) \tensor C
            \) called the \emph{associator};
        \item \(
            \leftunitor{A}
            \colon
            I \tensor A
            \cong
            A
            \) called the \emph{left unitor}; and
        \item \(
            \rightunitor{A}
            \colon
            A \tensor I
            \cong
            A
            \) called the \emph{right unitor}
    \end{itemize}
    such that the \emph{pentagon} and the \emph{triangle} diagrams below
    commute:
    \begin{center}
        \includestandalone{figures/category/coherences/pentagon}

        \vspace{1em}

        \includestandalone{figures/category/coherences/triangle}
    \end{center}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    \(\set\) is a monoidal category, with the tensor product defined as the
    Cartesian product (\(A \tensor B := A \times B\)) and the unit as the
    singleton set (\(I := \mathbbm{1}\)).
\end{example}


\begin{notation}
    We adopt the convention that \(f \tensor g \seq h \tensor k\) should be
    bracketed as \((f \tensor g) \seq (h \tensor k)\), i.e.\ \(\tensor\) binds
    more strongly than \(\seq\).
\end{notation}

We will use the \(\tensor\) bifunctor extensively through this thesis.
For this reason, when drawing string diagrams for monoidal categories we will
not forego drawing the (bi)functor boxes and usually draw wires exclusively in
their `deconstructed' state: instead of a single wire \(A \tensor B\) we will
draw two wires \(A\) and \(B\).

\begin{gather*}
    \iltikzfig{strings/monoidal/tensor-notation-compact}[colour=white,dom1=A,dom2=C,cod1=B,cod2=D,box1=f,box2=g]
    :=
    \iltikzfig{strings/monoidal/tensor-notation-boxes}[colour=white,dom1=A,dom2=C,cod1=B,cod2=D,box1=f,box2=g]
    :=
    \iltikzfig{strings/monoidal/tensor-notation-hybrid}[colour=white,dom1=A,dom2=C,cod1=B,cod2=D,box1=f,box2=g]
    :=
    \iltikzfig{strings/monoidal/tensor-notation-noboxes}[colour=white,dom1=A,dom2=C,cod1=B,cod2=D,box1=f,box2=g]
\end{gather*}

The definition of monoidal category we have presented is quite general,
particularly with regards to the natural isomorphisms for unitors and
associators.
In our setting, it is normally sufficient for these isomorphisms to hold `on the
nose'.

\begin{definition}[Strict monoidal category]
    A monoidal category is \emph{strict} if \(\lambda\), \(\rho\) and \(\alpha\)
    are identities.
\end{definition}

In a strict monoidal category, the unitality and associativity of the tensor
hold as equations, as they do for regular composition in a category.
With this in mind, it can be instructive to view the coherences of a strict
monoidal category in terms of equations: these are listed in
\cref{fig:mc-equations}.
Once again, intuition is better gleaned when these equations are drawn as string
diagrams, as illustrated in \cref{fig:mc-equations-strings}.

\input{floats/mc-equations-strings}

\begin{example}
    \(\set\) is a monoidal category, with the tensor product defined as the
    Cartesian product (\(A \tensor B := A \times B\)) and the unit as the
    singleton set (\(I := \mathbbm{1}\)).
\end{example}

\subsection{Symmetric monoidal categories}

We can now construct morphisms by composing them in sequence and in parallel.
However, there is no way to cross over the wires that connect boxes together.
This can be achieved by equipping the categorical setting with another natural
isormorphism.

\begin{definition}[Symmetric monoidal category]
    \label{def:symmetric-monoidal-category}
    A \emph{symmetric monoidal category} (SMC) is a monoidal category \(\mcc\)
    equipped with a natural isomorphism \(
        \swap{A}{B} \colon A \tensor B \cong B \tensor A
    \) such that the following diagrams commute:
    \begin{center}
        \includestandalone{figures/category/coherences/symmetry-unit}
        \includestandalone{figures/category/coherences/symmetry-inverse}

        \vspace{1em}

        \includestandalone[scale=0.95]{figures/category/coherences/hexagon}
    \end{center}
\end{definition}

Recall that as \(\sigma\) is a natural isomorphism, it induces
a \emph{family} of morphisms \(
    \morph{\swap{A}{B}}{A \tensor B}{B \tensor A}
\) for every pair of objects \(A\) and \(B\).
In string diagrams, each such morphism \(\swap{A}{B}\) is drawn as \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/symmetric/symmetry}[obj1=A, obj2=B, colour=white]
\): the swapping of wires \(A\) and \(B\).
As with identities, the use of this morphism is so common that we usually
drop the box around it.

Once again, we are primarily concerned with \emph{strict} symmetric
monoidal categories.
The equations of strict symmetric monoidal categories are listed in
\cref{fig:smc-equations} and the string diagram interpretations in
\cref{fig:smc-equations-strings}.

\begin{example}
    \(\set\) is a symmetric monoidal category, with \(
        \morph{\swap{A}{B}}{A \times B}{B \times A}
    \) defined as the function that swaps elements of a pair.
\end{example}
