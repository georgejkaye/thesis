\section{Semantics}

All the pieces are now in place to define the categorical setting for reasoning
about terms.

\begin{definition}\label{def:freely-generated-prop}
    Given a set of generators \(\generators\), let \(\smc{\generators}\) be the
    \(\natplus\)-sorted PROP where \(
        \smc{\generators}(\overline{m}, \overline{n})
    \) is the set of \(\Sigma\)-terms of type \(\overline{m} \to \overline{n}\).
\end{definition}

Such a category is known as a \emph{PROP freely generated over} \(\Sigma\).
