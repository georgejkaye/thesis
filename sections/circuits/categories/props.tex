\section{PROPs}

Symmetrical monoidal categories provide en


We have described the categorical structure required to interpret five of the
constructors listed in \cref{def:terms}; only the `bundlers'
\(\bundle{\overline{m}}{\overline{n}}\) remain.
However, to give these meaning we must consider a slightly more specialised
setting; a subclass of symmetric monoidal categories known as \emph{PROPs}.

\begin{definition}[Multi-sorted PROP~\cite{maclane1965categorical}]
    Given a set of \emph{sorts} \(\mcc\), a \(\mcc\)-sorted \emph{PROP}
    (category of \emph{PRO}ducts and \emph{P}ermutations) is a strict symmetric
    monoidal category with the objects as words in \(\freemon{\mcc}\) and tensor
    product as concatenation.
\end{definition}

Note that this definition means that the empty word \(\varepsilon\) is the unit
object in any \(\mcc\)-sorted PROP.
As the domain and codomains of generators in \(\generators\) are words of
natural numbers, it is clear to see how a multi-sorted PROP can be used for our
scenario.

\begin{definition}\label{def:freely-generated-prop}
    Given a set of generators \(\generators\), let \(\smc{\generators}\) be the
    \(\natplus\)-sorted PROP where \(
        \smc{\generators}(\overline{m}, \overline{n})
    \) is the set of \(\Sigma\)-terms of type \(\overline{m} \to \overline{n}\).
\end{definition}
