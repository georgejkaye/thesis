\section{Monotone Mealy machines}

It is not immediately obvious how to translate back from stream functions in
\(\streami\) to circuits in \(\scircsigma\).
Even though these stream functions have finitely many stream derivatives, how
does one encapsulate this behaviour into a circuit made from finitely many
components while taking into account inputs and state?
Fortunately, we have a secret weapon; the old chestnut that is the
\emph{Mealy machine}~\cite{mealy1955method}.
Working tirelessly in industry as a way of specifying the behaviour of a
circuit without restricting to particular circuitry, Mealy machines also have
a very useful \emph{coalgebraic} viewpoint which we will wield in order to
build a bridge from circuits into stream functions: there is a unique
homomorphism from a Mealy machine to a causal, finitely specified stream
function.

We will do this by assembling a special class of Mealy machines which we dub
\emph{monotone Mealy machines} into another traced PROP.
By constructing PROP morphisms between these two categories that preserve
behaviour of stream functions, we establish that we can work with either
circuit representation.

\begin{definition}[Mealy machine~\cite{mealy1955method}]\label{def:mealy}
    Let \(A\) and \(B\) be finite sets.
    A (finite) \((A,B)\)-\emph{Mealy machine} is a tuple \((S, f)\) where
    \(S\) is a finite set called the \emph{state space},
    \(\morph{f}{S}{(S \times B)^A}\) is the \emph{Mealy function}.
\end{definition}

An \((M,N\)-Mealy machine is parameterised over a set \(A\) of \emph{inputs} and
a set \(B\) of \emph{outputs}.
Each Mealy machine then has a set \(S\) of \emph{states}; the Mealy function
takes in a currrent state and input \((s, a)\) and produces a pair
\(\langle{s^\prime, b}\rangle\)of a transition and output.

\begin{notation}
    We will use the shorthand \(
    \mealyfunctiontransition{f} := (s, a) \mapsto \proj{0}(f(s)(a))
\) and \(
    \mealyfunctionoutput{f} := (s, a) \mapsto \proj{1}(f(s)(a))
\) for the transition and output component of the Mealy function respectively.
\end{notation}

\end{example}

\subsection{The coalgebraic perspective}

The definition of Mealy machine above is timeless and forms the basis for most
of modern electronics.
Of course, the natural question for the categorist to ask is
\emph{can we make it more categorical?}
And as is often the case, we can, using the notion of a \emph{coalgebra}.

\begin{definition}[Coalgebra]
    Let \(\mcc\) and \(\mcd\) be categories, and let \(\morph{F}{\mcc}{\mcc}\)
    be an endofunctor.
    A \emph{coalgebra} for \(F\), or \(F\)-coalgebra, is an object
    \(A \in \mcc\) along with a morphism \(\morph{\alpha}{A}{FA} \in \mcc\),
    usually written \((A,\alpha)\).
\end{definition}

The light bulb should already have lit up: a Mealy machine is a pair of a set
and a function, so this is clearly a coalgebra in \(\set\).

\begin{definition}
    An \emph{\((A,B)\)-Mealy coalgebra} is a coalgebra of the functor
    \(\morph{Y}{\set}{\set}\) defined as \(S \mapsto (S \times B)^A\).
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    In \cite{bonsangue2008coalgebraic}, the notation \(
        f(s)(a) = \langle{\streaminit{s}{a},\streamderivative{s}{a}}\rangle
    \) is used to describe the Mealy function, which coincides with the notation
    used for stream functions; this is not a coincidence!

    Given sets \(A\) and \(B\), let \(\Gamma\) be the set of causal stream
    functions \(\stream{A} \to \stream{B}\), and let
    \(\morph{\nu}{\Gamma}{\Gamma \times B}^A\) be the function defined as \(
        (f, a) \mapsto \langle{\streaminit{s}{a},\streamderivative{s}{a}}\rangle
    \).
    Then \((\Gamma,\nu)\) is a \((A,B)\)-Mealy coalgebra.
\end{example}

The above example is incredibly important, as it lays the groundwork we will
use extensively to establish connections between circuits, stream functions and
Mealy machines.
If we inspect it a little closer, we find that stream functions are even more
special than just being `a' \((A,B)\)-Mealy coalgebra.

\begin{definition}[Mealy homomorphism]
    For sets \(A\) and \(B\), an \emph{\(A,B\)-Mealy homomorphism} between two
    \((A,B)\)-Mealy coalgebra \((S,f)\) and \((T,g)\) is a function
    \(\morph{h}{S}{T}\) preserving transitions and
    outputs, i.e.\ for a Mealy function \(f\), a Mealy homomorphism \(h\)
    satisfies \(
        h\left(\mealyfunctiontransition{f}(s, a)\right)
        =
        \mealyfunctiontransition{f}(h(s), a)
    \) and \(
        h\left(\mealyfunctionoutput{f}(s, a)\right)
        =
        \mealyfunctionoutput{f}(s, a)
    \).
\end{definition}

The \emph{final} \((M,N)\)-Mealy coalgebra is a \((M,N)\)-Mealy coalgebra to
which every other \((M,N)\)-Mealy coalgebra has a unique homomorphism to.

\begin{remark}
    The coalgebra crowd tend to prefer the use of the word \emph{final} over
    \emph{terminal}; one could quite reasonably call the final coalgebra a
    terminal coalgebra and everything would be alright, but you might get a few
    funny looks.
\end{remark}

\begin{proposition}[\cite{rutten2006algebraic}, Prop. 2.2]
    \label{prop:final-coalgebra}
    For every \((A,B)\)-Mealy coalgebra \((S,f)\), there exists a
    unique \((A,B)\)-Mealy homomorphism \(\morph{{!}}{(S,f)}{(\Gamma,\nu)}\).
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    An \((A,B)\)-Mealy homomorphism \(\morph{g}{(S, f)}{(\Gamma, \nu)}\) is a
    function \(S \to \Gamma\), so for a state \(s_0 \in S\), \(g(s)\) will be a
    stream function \(\stream{A} \to \stream{B}\).
    Let \(\sigma \in \stream{A}\) be an input stream; there is a (unique) series
    of transitions \[
        s_0
        \mealyarrow{\sigma(0)}{b_0}
        s_1
        \mealyarrow{\sigma(1)}{b_1}
        s_2
        \mealyarrow{\sigma(2)}{b_2}
        s_3
        \mealyarrow{\sigma(3)}{b_3}
        \cdots
    \]
    The unique stream function \(!(s)\) is defined for input \(\sigma\) and
    index \(i \in \nat\) as \(!(s)(\sigma)(i) \coloneqq b_i\).
\end{proof}

For a Mealy coalgebra \((S, f)\) and a start state \(s_0\),
\(!(s)(\sigma)\) maps to the stream of outputs that \((S, f)\) would produce
by repeatedly applying \(f\) to each element of \(\sigma\), starting from
\(s_0\).

When viewed through this perspective, stream functions are nothing more than the
states in another Mealy machine.
However, this is not just any Mealy machine, it is the \emph{minimal} Mealy
machine with the same behaviour as \((S, f)\).

\subsection{Circuits as Mealy machines}

The fact that causal stream functions are the final Mealy coalgebra is the
ingredient that will help us build a bridge between circuits in \(\scircsigma\)
and stream functions in \(\streami\).
The crucial step is to now assemble Mealy machines into another traced PROP
and define PROP morphisms between all three categories in play.

However, not all Mealy machines defined thus far correspond to circuits in
\(\scircsigma\).
As with stream functions, we must refine our notion of Mealy machine in
order to find those that do.
There is an easy check for this: a Mealy machine \((S, f)\) with start state
\(s_0\) specifies the behaviour of a circuit in \(\scircsigma\) if the
stream function \(!(s_0)\) is in \(\streami\).

As established, all stream functions in the image of \(!\) are causal, and since
we only work with \emph{finite} Mealy machines we can also conclude the
following:

\begin{lemma}
    Given a Mealy machine \((S, f)\) and start state \(s_0 \in S\), \(!(s_0)\)
    is finitely specified.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    \(S\) is finite, and \(\mealytostream\) must preserve transitions.
\end{proof}

Monotonicity is a little less straightforward.
One could set the input, output and state sets to all be posets, and use the
usual definition of monotonicity that way.
However, this overcomplicates things: since each Mealy coalgebra has a
corresponding stream function, we can appeal to this rather than having to
manually order the state set.

First an ordering on stream \emph{functions} is required.

\begin{definition}
    Let \(A\) and \(B\) be posets.
    For stream functions \(\morph{f,g}{\stream{A}}{\stream{B}}\), we say that
    \(f \stateorder g\) if, for all \(\sigma \in \stream{A}\),
    \(f(\sigma) \leq_{\stream{B}}\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[State order]
    Let \(A\) and \(B\) posets.
    For an \((A,B)\)-Mealy machine \((S, f)\) and states \(s,s^\prime \in S\)
    we say that \(s \stateorder s^\prime\) if \(!(s) \stateorder !(s^\prime)\).
\end{definition}

With an ordering on the states of a Mealy machine, monotonicity follows rather
easily.

\begin{definition}[Monotone Mealy machine]
    Let \(A\) and \(B\) be posets; an \((A,B)\)-Mealy machine is called a
    \emph{monotone} Mealy machine if \(f\) is monotone with respect to the
    appropriate orders.
\end{definition}

This establishes the properties of Mealy machines required to model circuits.
all that remains is their composition, which is standard.

\begin{definition}[Cascade product~\cite{ginzburg2014algebraic}]
    Given an \((A,B)\)-Mealy machine \((S,f)\) with start state \(s_0\) and
    an \((B,C)\)-Mealy machine \((T,g)\) with state state \((t_0)\), their
    \emph{cascade product} is an \((A,C)\)-Mealy machine defined as \[
        (S \times T, ((s, t), a) \mapsto ((
            \mealyfunctiontransition{f}(s,a),
            \mealyfunctiontransition{g}(t, \mealyfunctionoutput{f}(s, a))
        ),
            \mealyfunctionoutput{g}(t, \mealyfunctionoutput{f}(s, a))
        )).
    \]
\end{definition}

The cascade product of two Mealy machines effectively executes the first on the
inputs, then executes the second on the outputs of the first.
