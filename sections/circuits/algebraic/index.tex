\chapter{Algebraic semantics}

Testing that the behaviour of two circuits is equivalent by testing that every
input produces the same output for each circuit is a perfectly reasonable
strategy.
But this is somewhat of a `nuclear strategy'; rather than using what we know
about the structure of a circuit's subcomponents, we just blast away
exhaustively trying all the inputs to find a contradiction.

A more elegant method of reasoning is by utilising \emph{equations} between
subcircuits.
A proof of equivalence between two circuits is then presented using algebraic
reasoning: applying equations to translate one circuit into the other.
This is often \emph{far more efficient} than having to test every input!

This is the focus of our final perspective on semantics for sequential
circuits, \emph{algebraic semantics}.
