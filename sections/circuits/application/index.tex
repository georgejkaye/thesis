\chapter{Potential applications}

So far, we have been concerned largely with \emph{theoretical} concepts; we have
shown how the categorical framework of sequential digital circuits is rigorous
enough for mathematicians to use without breaking anything.

Unfortunately, if one tries to spout category theory at people in industry,
they'll often respond with blank looks before you are swiftly escorted from the
building and instructed never to return.
Instead, they are more concerned with the \emph{practical} benefits of the
framework: what can we do with it that cannot already be done?

Circuit design is already a very well-studied area and existing technologies are
incredibly successful: after all, digital circuits have become the backbone of
our society!
Our framework is therefore not meant to \emph{replace} the existing
technologies, but to \emph{complement} them by highlighting different
perspectives on reasoning with sequential digital circuits.
While the ideas provided in this section are certainly not industry-grade
applications just yet, they are intended to demonstrate the potential of what
the compositional theory can bring to the (already busy) table.
