\section{Observational equivalence}

In the denotational semantics, we defined the relation of
\emph{denotational equivalence}, in which circuits are related if their
denotations as streams are equal.
For operational semantics we have another notion of relation on circuits: that
of \emph{observational equivalence}.
This is due to Morris~\cite{morris1969lambdacalculus}, who named it
`extensional equivalence': essentially, two processes are observationally if they
cannot be distinguished by their input-output behaviour.
To apply this to circuits we first define some notation for sequences of inputs
to a circuit.

\begin{notation}[Waveform]\label{def:waveform}
    The empty waveform is defined as \(
        \iltikzfig{circuits/components/waveforms/sigma0}
        \coloneqq
        \iltikzfig{strings/category/identity}[colour=comb,obj=n]
    \).
    Given values \(\overline{v} \in \valuetuple{n}\) and sequence \(
        \overline{\underline{w}} \in (\valuetuple{n})^\star
    \), the waveform for sequence \(
        \overline{v} \streamcons \overline{\underline{w}}
    \) is drawn as \(
        \iltikzfig{circuits/components/waveforms/sigmatp1-spaced}
        \coloneqq
        \iltikzfig{circuits/components/waveforms/sigmatp1-construction-spaced}
    \).
\end{notation}

Testing for observational equivalence is traditionally performed by checking
that a program behaves the same in all \emph{contexts}.
In the setting of digital circuits, this means that for all possible streams of
inputs, the circuit produces the same inputs.
Of course, there are infinitely many streams of inputs, despite the set of
values being finite.
Fortunately, since circuits are constructed from a finite number of
\emph{components}, we need not check them all.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:number-of-states}
    Let \(
        \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=F,colour=seq]
    \) be a sequential circuit with \(c\) delay components.
    Then applying \cref{cor:productivity} successively to a Mealy form of this
    circuit will produce at most \(|\values|^c\) unique states.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    The only varying elements of the state word are contributed by
    the \(c\) delay components, as the values transition to \(\bot\).
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:repeated-state}
    Given a circuit in Mealy form \(
        \iltikzfig{circuits/productivity/mealy-form}[dom=m,cod=n,delay=x]
    \) and input sequence \(\listlistvar{v} \in \valuetupleseq{m}\) of length
    \(|\values|^c + 1\), there exists a state \(
        \listvar{r} \in \valuetuple{x}
    \), an input sequence \(
        \listlistvar{u} \in \valuetupleseq{m}
    \) and output sequences \(
        \listlistvar{w},\listlistvar{z} \in \valuetupleseq{n}
    \) such that applying \cref{cor:productivity} yields the
    following reduction pattern: \begin{gather*}
        \iltikzfig{circuits/productivity/mealy-form-waveform}
        \reductions
        \iltikzfig{circuits/productivity/mealy-form-waveform-partial}[state=\listvar{r},output=\listlistvar{w},input=\listlistvar{u}]
        \reductions
        \iltikzfig{circuits/productivity/mealy-form-waveform-output-2}[state=\listvar{r},output1=\listlistvar{z},output2=\listlistvar{w}]
    \end{gather*}
\end{corollary}

This means that every possible behaviour of a circuit can be evaluated using
a finite number of streams.
This can be used to define our notion of observational equivalence for digital
circuits.

\begin{definition}[Observational equivalence of circuits]
    We say that two sequential circuits \(
        \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=F,colour=seq,dom=m,cod=n]
    \) and \(
        \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=G,colour=seq,dom=m,cod=n]
    \) with no more than \(c\) delays are said to be
    \emph{observationally equivalent under} \(\interpretation\), written \(
        \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=F,colour=seq]
        \sim_{\interpretation}
        \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=G,colour=seq]
    \) if applying productivity produces the same output
    waveforms for all input waveforms \(
        \listlistvar{v} \in \valuetupleseq{m}\) of length
        \(|\values^c| + 1\).
\end{definition}

To verify that this is the `best' such relation, we turn to a
definition of observational equivalence in terms of universal
properties~\cite{gordon1998operational}.
Gordon states that a relation is an \emph{adequate} observational semantics if
it only relates circuits that have the same denotational semantics;
observational equivalence is then defined as the largest adequate congruence.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:operational-denotational}
    Given two sequential circuits \(
        \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=F,colour=seq,dom=m,cod=n]
    \) and \(
        \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=G,colour=seq,dom=m,cod=n]
    \), \(
        \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=F,colour=seq,dom=m,cod=n]
        \sim_\interpretation
        \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=G,colour=seq,dom=m,cod=n]
    \) if and only if \(
        \circuittostreami[
            \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=F,colour=seq,dom=m,cod=n]
        ]
        =
        \circuittostreami[
            \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=G,colour=seq,dom=m,cod=n]
        ]
    \).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The \(\onlyifdir\) direction follows by \cref{cor:repeated-state}, as every
    possible internal configuration of the circuit will be tested.
    For \(\ifdir\), if \(
        \circuittostreami[
            \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=F,colour=seq,dom=m,cod=n]
        ]
        =
        \circuittostreami[
            \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=G,colour=seq,dom=m,cod=n]
        ]
    \), then this means \(
        \circuittostreami[
            \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=F,colour=seq,dom=m,cod=n]
        ](\listlistvar{v} \streamcons \sigma)
        =
        \circuittostreami[
            \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=G,colour=seq,dom=m,cod=n]
        ](\listlistvar{v} \streamcons \sigma)
    \) for any \(\sigma,\tau \in \valuetuplestream{m}\).
    By definition of \(\circuittostreami\), we then have that \(
        \circuittostreami[
        \iltikzfig{circuits/components/circuits/f-applied-waveform}[box=F,colour=seq,dom=m,cod=n,input=\listlistvar{v}]
        ](\sigma)
        =
        \circuittostreami[
            \iltikzfig{circuits/components/circuits/f-applied-waveform}[box=G,colour=seq,dom=m,cod=n,input=\listlistvar{v}]
        ](\sigma)
    \).
    Since this holds for \emph{all} sequences \(\listlistvar{v}\), it must hold
    for those of length \(|\values|^c + 1\), so the condition for observational
    equivalence is met.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
    \(\sim_\interpretation\) is the largest adequate congruence on
    \(\scircsigma\).
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
    For \(\sim_\interpretation\) to be a congruence it must be preserved by
    composition, tensor and trace, and for it to be the largest there must be
    no denotationally equal circuit it does not relate.
    These, along with adequacy, all follow by
    \cref{thm:operational-denotational}.
\end{proof}

This makes \(\sim_\interpretation\) a suitable notion of observational
equivalence for sequential circuits.

\begin{definition}
    Let \(\scircsigmaobs\) be defined as
    \(\scircsigma / \sim_{\interpretation}\).
\end{definition}

\begin{corollary}
    There is an isomorphism \(\scircsigmai \cong \scircsigmaobs\).
\end{corollary}

The results of the previous section give us an upper bound on the length of
waveforms required to establish observational semantics; this means that we have
a terminating strategy for comparing the behaviour of digital circuits.
Unfortunately, this is still an \emph{exponential} upper bound, so it is
infeasible to check for the equivalence of circuits with more than a few delay
components.

Nevertheless, the operational semantics gives us a straightforward way to
\emph{evaluate} circuits while respecting their internal structure, which can
unlock more insight as to \emph{why} circuits are behaving the way they
are.

Moreover, while it may be infeasible to check \emph{every single possible input}
to a circuit, it may be far easier to check equivalence for a subset of known
inputs.
Often, it is the case that one knows a particular input is fixed for long
periods of time: perhaps it is some sort of control signal.
By precomposing the appropriate input with an infinite waveform to represent
this fixed input, \todo{Maybe this can be
elaborated on}, the behaviour of the circuit can be evaluated and inspected.
