\section{Category theory and compositionality}

Category theory is an especially natural concept to apply to computer science
because it is a setting in which \emph{composition} is king.
Rather than dealing with complicated and unwieldy terms, we can split them
up into simpler \emph{components}, which can themselves be split up into simpler
components and so on until we reach some sort of atomic components at the leaves
of the tree.
This means that if one defines the behaviour of these atomic components and
how they interact with composition, it is possible to quickly establish the
behaviour of some larger time by piecing things together, and moreover we can
reason \emph{inductively} over the structure of composite terms.
Composition is not even restricted to the mathematical realm; it is generally
considered good practice to write programs in terms of small, easily reusable
pieces that can be pieced together by composing functions, which is why
functional programming paradigms are starting to creep into even the most
imperative of languages.

But what exactly does it mean for a theory to be \emph{fully} compositional?
It is a term often thrown around without much thought to its precise meaning,
not least by the author while attempting to bat off questions about their work's
novelty from anonymous reviewers, conference attendees, and esteemed
mathematicians on social media.
Here, we take full compositionality to mean that we can compose terms without
fear that we willsomehow create a degenerate term and leave our well-behaved
setting.
We should not have to perform any sort of semantic check or `peek inside' a term
to find out if composition is permitted; we should be able to treat everything
as a black box and reason solely with interfaces.

While compositionality is the core tenet of all category theory, it is in
\emph{symmetric monoidal categories}~\cite{maclane1963natural} where the power
really starts to shine.
In these categories, the usual \emph{sequential} composition is joined by
another operation called the \emph{tensor}, which can be interpreted as a notion
of \emph{parallel} composition.
This opens a whole new dimension to play with, and allows for a plethora of
interesting structures to be modelled.
Our setting of digital circuits introduces another way of creating new things
from simpler components: we can create a \emph{feedback loop} by attaching some
outputs to inputs.
This too can be viewed in a categorical perspective in the form of a
\emph{symmetric traced monoidal category}~\cite{joyal1996traced}.

Perhaps the most well known application of symmetric monoidal categories in
recent times is for modelling
\emph{quantum protocols}~\cite{abramsky2004categorical}.
This line of work resulted in the
\emph{ZX calculus}~\cite{coecke2008interacting}, in which quantum
circuits are depicted by connecting so-called `spiders' together to create a
network.
The latter is a key example of \emph{string diagrams}~\cite{joyal1991geometry},
a graphical notation for symmetric monoidal categories.
Since their inception, string diagrams have been extended with notation for all
sorts of categorical structure, such as for a trace~\cite{joyal1996traced}; we
refer the reader to Selinger's survey~\cite{selinger2011survey} for the full
tour.

While string diagrams do not add any more computational power to
standard one-dimensional reasoning, they are
immensely beneficial because the categorical axioms of associativity and
unitality are `absorbed' by the notation: two terms are equal if and only if
their string diagrams are isomorphic~\cite{kelly1980coherence,kissinger2014abstract}.
This makes proofs far less bureaucratic, meaning that the mathematician need
only focus on the non-trivial steps without having to constantly rearrange the
bracketing of a term.
As a useful aside, they also make the work more approachable and easier to
explain to non-mathematicians.
With string diagrams, it is possible to give talks about category theory without
even mentioning categories at all; there have even been books written with this
philosophy~\cite{coecke2018picturing}!

String diagrams, and more broadly the use of monoidal categories to model
compositional processes, has seen an explosion in the past thirty years.
They have been used in the study of cyclic lambda
calculi~\cite{hasegawa1997recursion}, fixpoint including dynamical
systems~\cite{baez2015categories,fong2016categorical}, signal flow
diagrams~\cite{bonchi2014categorical,bonchi2015full,bonchi2017refinement,bonchi2021survey},
linear algebra~\cite{bonchi2017interacting,zanasi2015interacting,bonchi2019graphical,boisseau2022graphical},
finite-state automata~\cite{piedeleu2021string,piedeleu2022finite}, first order
logic~\cite{bonchi2024diagrammatic}, electrical
circuits~\cite{boisseau2022string} and automatic
differentiation~\cite{alvarez-picallo2023functorial}.

\section{Compositionality and sequential circuits}

One might argue that composition is already widespread in sequential circuit
design, and indeed it is: circuits are constructed by connecting lots of very
common primitive components together to make something more complex.
But this is done informally, as the behaviour of a circuit is usually tested
by \emph{simulating} it and seeing what happens.
We can simulate the subcomponents, but what does this mean for their composite?
Without a mathematical guarantee of full compositionality, we have no guarantee
that connecting two well-behaved circuits together will result in another
well-behaved circuit: for example, there is always the threat of the dreaded
\emph{non-delay-guarded feedback} rearing its head and leading to unpredictable
behaviour.

Some approaches try to nullify this by considering only some `safe' subset of
circuits which will always be well-behaved~\cite{christensen2021wire}, or by
introducing some sort of `type system' on wires so that components may only be
connected if their timings match up~\cite{nigam2023modular}.
While these are useful perspectives on the problem, this is still shying away
from truly full compositionality.
Our goals are simple: we wish to be able to compose \emph{any} two circuits
together without our reasoning falling apart.
The result of the composition may not produce anything useful, but we will still
be able to see that this is the case.

Of course, we cannot claim that mathematics had ignored sequential circuits
until we came along!
\emph{Mealy machines}~\cite{mealy1955method}, the \emph{de facto} structure for
specifying the behaviour of sequential circuits, are ancient and it is well
known how they should be composed (e.g. \cite{ginzburg2014algebraic}).
In more recent times Mealy machines have been given a categorical treatment as
certain kinds of \emph{coalgebra}~\cite{rutten2006algebraic,bonsangue2008coalgebraic}.
However, Mealy machines abstract away from the \emph{components} of the circuit:
we are keen to preserve the link between structure and behaviour by constructing
circuits as morphisms in some symmetric monoidal category.

While not explicitly categorical, the idea of representing circuits as
mathematical expressions built up from primitive components was studied in the
80s by Mike Gordon, who worked on
\emph{denotational semantics for sequential machines}~\cite{gordon1980denotational}
and used this idea to present
\emph{a model of register transfer systems}~\cite{gordon1982model}.
Gordon subsequently noted that \emph{higher order logic} would make a good fit
for a hardware description language~\cite{gordon1985why}, and this has become
a ubiquitous concept in formal verification of hardware~\cite{gupta1992formal}.

It was at the turn of the millennium that the ball really got rolling when it
came to developing a \emph{categorical} theory of digital circuits.
In the early noughties, Yves Lafont presented an
\emph{algebraic theory of boolean circuits}~\cite{lafont2003algebraic}, which
already bears a great resemblance to the work presented in this thesis; circuits
are presented as morphisms in a symmetric monoidal category freely generated
over a set of primitive logic gates.

However, as the name might suggest, Lafont's work only considered circuits that
implemented \emph{Boolean functions}; these circuits did not have any notion of
delay or feedback.
It was not until 2016 that these circuits were given the categorical treatment
by Dan Ghica and Achim Jung~\cite{ghica2016categorical}, who were later joined
by Aliaume Lopez when considering how to use this for a graph-rewriting based
operational semantics~\cite{ghica2017diagrammatic}.

While this thesis would not have come about without this foundational work, it
was presented relatively informally and in a sometimes confusing manner:
the categories of circuits were quotiented by some equations that `seemed right'
without consulting any sort of `baseline' denotational semantics.
Moreover, these equations were not enough to handle all circuits, so the
categories were furthermore quotiented by a notion of `extensional equivalence',
but what this meant exactly was not made formal.

\section{Thesis outline}

This thesis is split into two parts, \emph{Semantics of Digital Circuits}, and
\emph{Graph Rewriting for Digital Circuits}.
These sections respectively correspond to two papers:
\emph{%
    A Fully Compositional Theory of Sequential Digital Circuits:
    Denotational, Operational and Algebraic Semantics%
}~\cite{ghica2024fully}, and \emph{%
    Rewriting Modulo Traced Monoidal Structure%
}~\cite{ghica2023rewriting}, which was published in
\emph{Formal Structures for Computation and Deduction (FSCD) 2023}.

In the first part, we define the categorical syntax of sequential digital
circuits and follow this up with three sound and complete semantic frameworks
for sequential digital circuits: denotational, operational, and algebraic.
Each of these frameworks has their own benefits and intended uses; together they
make a part of a comprehensive examination of semantics of digital circuits.
The framework is sufficiently general to encompass circuits constructed from
all manner of components ranging from the level of transistors to the level of
logic gates and beyond to higher abstraction, but to provide some intuition we
include an extended case study into circuits constructed from
\emph{Belnap logic gates}~\cite{belnap1977useful}, an extension of traditional
Boolean logic containing the usual \(\andgate\), \(\orgate\) and \(\notgate\)
gates.
The switch from a two-valued to a four-valued logic is crucial to how full
composition for sequential digital circuits has been obtained.

While this work marks the first time the semantics of sequential digital
circuits have been given a rigorous mathematical treatment, it is not really
feasible to apply the techniques to anything more than toy circuits by hand;
trying to apply the techniques to actual, practical, circuits would quickly lead
to someone having a very bad time.
In the second part of the thesis, we extend previous work on
\emph{string diagram rewriting}~\cite{bonchi2022string,bonchi2022stringa,bonchi2022stringb}
so we can apply it to sequential digital circuits; to be precise, we adapt it
for settings with a \emph{traced comonoid} structure.
Using graph rewriting, we can express the operational and algebraic semantics
in a language that is easy for computers can understand and reason with, opening
up the possibility for automatic reasoning about complex, actually useful,
digital sequential circuits.
