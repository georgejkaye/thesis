\section{Isolation equations}

So far, we have equations that can translate a combinational circuit into a
canonical representative; this means we can just normalise a circuit and then
use some sort of lookup table to retrieve the corresponding function.

The next step is to determine how to translate a circuit with an arbitrary
set of state words into the `one-hot' encoding of circuits in the image of
\(\mealytocircuiti\), in the state words have the same width as the number of
states in the circuit.
This means we will need some way of computing the number of states in the
circuit.
To do this, we add some equations for \emph{isolating} the transition and output
components of the combinational core.

\begin{definition}[Normalised Mealy form]
    A sequential circuit is in \emph{normalised Mealy form} if it is in the form
    \(
    \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/encoding}[transition={f_0},output={f_1},dom=\listvar{m},cod=\listvar{n},delay=\listvar{x}]
    \) where \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/category/f-2-1}[box=f_0,colour=seq]
    \) and \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/category/f-2-1}[box=f_1,colour=seq]
    \) are normalised circuits.
    Given such a circuit, we write \(
    \morph{\tilde{f}_{0}}{\valuetuple{x+m}}{{\valuetuple{x}}}
    \) and \(
    \morph{\tilde{f}_{1}}{\valuetuple{x+m}}{{\valuetuple{n}}}
    \) for the functions that satisfy \(
    \mealytofunc[\tilde{f}_{0}] = \iltikzfig{strings/category/f-2-1}[box=f_0,colour=seq]
    \) and \(
    \mealytofunc[\tilde{f}_{1}] = \iltikzfig{strings/category/f-2-1}[box=f_1,colour=seq]
    \).
\end{definition}

While it may be obvious which components of the circuit contribute to the
transition and which to the output, it is more likely that the components will
be tightly intertwined, with lots of sharing going on.
This means that to obtain a version of the circuit with the two parts separated
we may need to \emph{copy} components.
For those in the know, this can mean only one thing.

\begin{definition}[Cartesian category~\cite{fox1976coalgebras}]
    A category is \emph{Cartesian} if its tensor product is given by the Cartesian
    product, or, equivalently, if it satisfies the equations in
    \cref{fig:cartesian-axioms}.
\end{definition}

\input{sections/semantics/algebraic/floats/cartesian-equations}

We could quotient \(\scircsigma\) by the equations in
\cref{fig:cartesian-axioms}, but we prefer to use a finite number of equations.

\begin{definition}
    Let \(\cartesianequations\) be defined as the set of equations in
    \cref{fig:local-cartesian-equations}.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    Note that \((\forkjoineqn)\) and \((\joinforkeqn)\) induce equations on the
    `composite' forks and joins from \cref{not:arbitrary-width-structure}.
\end{remark}

\input{sections/semantics/algebraic/floats/local-cartesian-equations}

These equations are enough to bestow the Cartesian properties upon
\(\scircsigma\).
Before we can show this, we must show a lemma that establishes the settings
in which the fork is the inverse of the join.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:join-fork-inverse}
    For any sequential circuit \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/category/f-1-2}[box=F,colour=seq,dom=m,cod1=n,cod2=p]
    \), \(
    \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/lhs}[box=f,dom=\listvar{m},cod1=\listvar{n},cod2=\listvar{p}]
    =
    \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/rhs}[box=f,dom=\listvar{m},cod1=\listvar{n},cod2=\listvar{p}]
    \) holds in \(\scircsigma / \mcc\).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    This is by induction over the structure of the circuit \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/category/f-1-2}[box=F,colour=seq]
    \).
    First we must check the base cases.
    For \(
    \iltikzfig{circuits/components/gates/gate}[gate=g,colour=comb]
    \):
    \begin{gather*}
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/gate-partial-step-0}
        \eqaxioms[(\gateforkeqn)]
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/gate-partial-step-1}
        \eqaxioms[(\forkjoineqn)]
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/gate-partial-step-2}
        \eqaxioms[(\gateforkeqn)]
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/gate-partial-step-3}
    \end{gather*}
    For \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/structure/comonoid/copy}[colour=comb]
    \) we first check if only one of the outputs are joined:
    \begin{gather*}
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/fork-single-step-0}
        \eqaxioms[(\comonoidassoceqnletter), (\comonoidcommeqnletter)]
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/fork-single-step-1}
        \eqaxioms[(\forkjoineqn)]
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/fork-single-step-2}
        \eqaxioms[(\comonoidassoceqnletter), (\comonoidcommeqnletter)]
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/fork-single-step-3}
    \end{gather*}
    And now if both outputs are joined:
    \begin{gather*}
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/fork-double-step-0}
        \eqaxioms[(\joinforkeqn)]
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/fork-double-step-1}
        \eqaxioms[(\forkjoineqn)]
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/fork-double-step-2}
        \eqaxioms[(\comonoidassoceqnletter), (\comonoidcommeqnletter)]
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/fork-double-step-3}
    \end{gather*}
    For \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/structure/monoid/merge}[colour=comb]
    \):
    \[
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/join-step-0}
        \eqaxioms[(\joinforkeqn)]
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/join-step-1}
        \eqaxioms[(\forkjoineqn)]
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/join-step-2}
        \eqaxioms[(\joinforkeqn)]
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/join-step-3}
    \]
    For \(
    \iltikzfig{circuits/components/waveforms/delay}
    \): \[
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/delay-step-0}
        \eqaxioms[(\delayforkeqn)]
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/delay-step-1}
        \eqaxioms[(\forkjoineqn)]
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/delay-step-2}
        \eqaxioms[(\delayforkeqn)]
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/delay-step-3}
    \]
    The proofs for \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/structure/monoid/init}[colour=comb]
    \), \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/category/identity}[colour=comb]
    \), \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/symmetric/symmetry}[colour=comb]
    \) and \(
    \iltikzfig{circuits/components/values/vs}
    \) are trivial.

    For composition, we need to show that \(
    \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/composition-lhs}
    =
    \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/composition-rhs}
    \).
    By inductive hypothesis, \(
    \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/simple-lhs}[box=f]
    =
    \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/simple-rhs}[box=f]
    \) so we have that \[
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/composition-lhs}[box1=f,box2=g]
        =
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/composition-step-1}[box1=f,box2=g]
        =
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/composition-step-2}[box1=f,box2=g]
        =
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/composition-rhs}[box1=f,box2=g].
    \]

    For tensor, we just need to apply the inductive hypothesis twice as the
    there are two circuits which do not interact.

    For trace we need to show that \(
    \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/trace-lhs}[box=f]
    =
    \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/trace-rhs}[box=f]
    \).
    By using axioms of STMCs and inductive hypothesis we have that \[
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/trace-lhs}[box=f]
        =
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/trace-step-1}[box=f]
        =
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/trace-step-2}[box=f]
        =
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/join-fork-inverse/trace-rhs}[box=f].
    \]
\end{proof}

Now we move onto the main result.
This proof is essentially the same as~\cite[Thm.\ 6]{ghica2016categorical}, but
here we are clear about exactly what equations and results are being applied,
since \(\scircsigma\) has not been quotiented by `extensional equivalence'.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:scirc-cartesian}
    \(\scircsigma / \cartesianequations + \instantfeedbackeqn\) is Cartesian.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    As the comonoid equations are contained within \(\cartesianequations\) and
    the coherence equations hold by definition of the arbitrary width forks in
    \cref{not:arbitary-width-notation}, we just need to show that the two
    equations in \cref{fig:cartesian-axioms} hold; in both cases this is by
    induction.
    The naturality of the copy for the generators immediate by the relevant
    equations in \cref{fig:local-cartesian-equations}; for composition and
    tensor the inductive hypothesis is applied to each subcircuit.
    For trace it is more involved:
    \begin{gather*}
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/cartesian/trace-step-0}
        \eqaxioms[\stmcequations]
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/cartesian/trace-step-1}
        \eqaxioms[(\forkjoineqn)]
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/cartesian/trace-step-2}
        \eqaxioms[\stmcequations]
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/cartesian/trace-step-3}
        \eqaxioms[\text{IH}]
        \\
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/cartesian/trace-step-4}
        \eqaxioms[\stmcequations]
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/cartesian/trace-step-5}
        \eqaxioms[\text{\cref{lem:join-fork-inverse}}]
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/cartesian/trace-step-6}
        \eqaxioms[\stmcequations]
        \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/cartesian/trace-step-7}
    \end{gather*}

    The naturality of the stub for the generators, composition and tensor is again
    immediate by equations in \cref{fig:local-cartesian-equations}.
    For the trace the circuit can be brought into global trace-delay form, followed
    by using \((\instantfeedbackeqn)\) and \((\delaydiscardeqn)\).
\end{proof}

The reason we are so interested in Cartesian categories in that they allow us
to \emph{isolate} outputs; given a circuit in Mealy form we are able to
translate its combinational core into two completely separate circuits for the
transition and the output.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:isolate-outputs}
    In a Cartesian category, \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/category/f-1-2}[box=f,colour=white,dom=\listvar{m},cod1=\listvar{n},cod2=\listvar{p}]
    =
    \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/isolate-cartesian/isolate}[box=f,colour=white,cod1=\listvar{n},cod2=\listvar{p}]
    \).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/category/f-1-2}[box=F,colour=white,dom=\listvar{m},cod1=\listvar{n},cod2=\listvar{p}]
    \eqaxioms[(\monoidunitleqn,\monoidunitreqn)]
    \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/isolate-cartesian/isolate-step-1}[box=f,colour=white,dom=\listvar{m},cod1=\listvar{n},cod2=\listvar{p}]
    \eqaxioms[(\cartnatcopyeqn)]
    \iltikzfig{circuits/algebraic/isolate-cartesian/isolate}[box=f,colour=white,dom=\listvar{m},cod1=\listvar{n},cod2=\listvar{p}]
    \)
\end{proof}

This means that any circuit can be brought to normalised Mealy form, and we are
one step closer to obtaining a circuit in the image of \(\mealytocircuiti\).

\begin{corollary}\label{lem:normalised-mealy}
    For a functionally complete interpretation \(\interpretation\), any
    sequential circuit \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=F,colour=seq,dom=m,cod=n]
    \) is equal to a circuit in normalised Mealy form in \(
    \scircsigma / (
    \mealyequations +
    \instantfeedbackeqn +
    \cartesianequations +
    \normalisingequations
    )
    \),
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
    Any circuit can be brought to Mealy form using
    \(\mealyequations + \instantfeedbackeqn\) by \cref{prop:mealy-equations};
    normalised Mealy form follows using
    \(\cartesianequations + \normalisingequations\).
\end{proof}
