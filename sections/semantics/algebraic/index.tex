\chapter{Algebraic semantics}\label{chap:algebraic}

The operational semantics and notion of observational equivalence means that
that the behaviour of two circuits can be compared by checking
whether every input produces the same output for both circuits.
But this is somewhat of a nuclear option; rather than using what we know
about the structure of a circuit's components, we just blast away
exhaustively trying all the inputs to find a contradiction.

A more elegant method of reasoning is by defining a set of \emph{equations}
between subcircuits and \emph{quotienting} \(\scircsigma\) by these equations.
A proof of equivalence between two circuits is then presented using algebraic
reasoning: applying equations to translate one circuit into the other.
This is often far more efficient than having test every input, and is
known formally as an \emph{algebraic} semantics.

\begin{example}\label{ex:expressions-algebraic}
    For the last time we return to the language of arithmetical expressions from
    \cref{ex:expressions-denotational}.
    An algebraic semantics for this language can be defined using a set of
    equations: the familiar equations of associativity, commutativity,
    unitality, annihiliation and distributivity, along with equations for
    performing arithmetic.
    \begin{gather*}
        add\,(add\,e_1\,e_2)\,e_3 = add\,e_1\,(add\,e_2\,e_3)
        \qquad
        mul\,(mul\,e_1\,e_2)\,e_3 = mul\,e_1\,(mul\,e_2\,e_3)
        \\
        add\,e_1\,e_2 = add\,e_2\,e_1
        \qquad
        mul\,e_1\,e_2 = mul\,e_2\,e_1
        \\
        add\,e_1\,\overline{0} = e_1
        \qquad
        mul\,e_1\,\overline{1} = e_1
        \qquad
        mul\,e_1\,\overline{0} = \overline{0}
        \\
        mul\,e_1\,(add\,e_2\,e_3) = add\,(mul\,e_1\,e_2)\,(mul\,e_1\,e_3)
        \\
        add\,\overline{n_1}\,\overline{n_2} = \overline{n_1+n_2}
        \qquad
        add\,\overline{n_1}\,\overline{n_2} = \overline{n_1 \cdot n_2}
    \end{gather*}
    If everything is specified concretely as values then one could easily just
    use the last two equations to compare two expressions by reducing
    two expressions to values as in the operational semantics.
    The power of the algebraic semantics comes from the fact we can reason
    abstractly with expressions containing \emph{blackboxes}.
    Take the following example, containing some arbitrary component \(e\).
    \begin{align*}
        mul\,(add\,e\,(mul\,e\,\overline{3}))\,\overline{2}
         & =
        mul\,(add\,(mul\,e\,1)\,(mul\,e\,\overline{3}))\,\overline{2}
        \\
         & =
        mul\,(mul\,e\, add(\overline{1}\,\overline{3}))\,\overline{2}
        \\
         & =
        mul\,(mul \,e\,\overline{4})\,\overline{2}
        \\
         & =
        mul\,e\,(mul \,\overline{4}\,\overline{2})
        \\
         & =
        mul\,e\,\overline{8}
        \\
         & =
        mul\,\overline{8}\,e
    \end{align*}
    Despite not specifying the structure of \(e\), we have
    shown how the expression is equal to a slightly simpler one.
    This process creates new general equations which can be used as `shortcuts'
    in future reasoning, potentially saving many steps.
\end{example}

As with the operational semantics, we are especially interested in defining a
\emph{sound and complete} algebraic semantics with respect to the denotational
semantics.
That is to say, for each equation \(
\iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=f,colour=seq]
=
\iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=g,colour=seq]
\) then \(
\circuittostreami[\iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=f,colour=seq]]
=
\circuittostreami[\iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=g,colour=seq]]
\), and there must be enough equations such that if \(
\circuittostreami[\iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=f,colour=seq]]
=
\circuittostreami[\iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=g,colour=seq]]
\) then there exists a series of equations identifying \(
\iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=f,colour=seq]
\) and \(
\iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=f,colour=seq]
\).

\begin{remark}
    An `equational theory' for sequential circuits was one of the first things
    presented in the previous
    work~\cite{ghica2016categorical,ghica2017diagrammatic}.
    In that paper, equations that `seemed right' were used to quotient the
    syntax, with the ultimate aim of showing that the resulting category was
    \emph{Cartesian}.
    This was done quite informally, and was made more confusing as
    the categories of circuits were subsequently quotiented by some notion of
    `extensional equivalence', an attempt to rectify the fact that the
    equations only dealt with closed circuits.
    Soundness and completeness of the equational theory was not considered
    because there was nothing to compare it against.

    In essence, the previous work was almost `the wrong way round': equations
    were defined and semantics drawn from them.
    In the more recent version of the work~\cite[Sec.\ 5]{ghica2024fully}, which
    forms the basis for this chapter, the equations are derived from the
    denotational semantics.
    Not only does this give us a formal way of verifying that these equations
    are sound, it sets the backdrop against which we can test if the algebraic
    semantics are sufficient: are any two denotationally equal circuits
    identified by equations?

\end{remark}

When defining such an equational theory, there may be several different sound
and complete formulations.
Ideally, we want to stick to simple \emph{local} equations that concern the
interactions of concrete generators as much as possible, but as we will see
we will sometimes have no choice but to define \emph{families} of equations
parameterised over some arbitrary subcircuit.
