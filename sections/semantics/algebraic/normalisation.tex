\section{Normalising circuits}\label{sec:normalising}

How does one start when trying to define a complete set of equations for some
framework?
Usually the strategy is to define enough equations to bring any term to some
sort of (pseudo-)\emph{normal form}; the theory is then complete if terms with
the same semantics have the same normal form.

We have already seen something that looks a bit like a normal form: the
\emph{Mealy form} from the previous section.
This is by no means a true normal form, as there are many different Mealy forms
that represent the same behaviour.
Nevertheless, it is a useful starting point so we will need equations to bring
circuits to Mealy form in our theory.

Instead of just turning the Mealy reduction rules into equations, we will show
how Mealy form can be derived using smaller equations.

\input{sections/semantics/algebraic/floats/mealy-equations}

\begin{definition}
    The set \(\mealyequations\) of \emph{Mealy equations} in
    \cref{fig:mealy-equations} are sound.
\end{definition}
\begin{proof}
    The first two rules hold as the join is a monoid in the stream semantics.
    The \((\bottomdelayeqn)\) holds because the semantics of the delay
    component are to output a \(\bot\) value first and then the (delayed)
    inputs: as the semantics of the \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/structure/monoid/init}[colour=comb]
    \) component are to \emph{always} produce \(\bot\), then it does not make a
    difference how delayed it is.
    The final equation is the instant feedback rule, which is sound by
    \cref{prop:instant-feedback}.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:mealy-equations}
    Given a sequential circuit \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=f,colour=seq,dom=m,cod=n]
    \), there exists a combinational circuit \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/category/f-2-2}[box=g,colour=comb,dom1=x,dom2=m,cod1=x,cod2=n]
    \) and values \(\listvar{s} \in \valuetuple{x}\) such that \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=f,colour=seq]
    =
    \iltikzfig{circuits/productivity/mealy-form}[core=g]
    \) in \(\scircsigma / \mealyequations\).
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Any circuit can be assembled into global trace-delay form solely using the
    axioms of STMCs.
    From this, a circuit in pre-Mealy form can be obtained by translating
    delays and values into registers using the following equations: \[
        \iltikzfig{circuits/axioms/delay-to-register/step-0}
        \eqaxioms[(\joinunitleqn)]
        \iltikzfig{circuits/axioms/delay-to-register/step-1}
        \qquad\quad
        \iltikzfig{circuits/axioms/value-to-register/step-0}
        \eqaxioms[(\joinunitreqn)]
        \iltikzfig{circuits/axioms/value-to-register/step-1}
        \eqaxioms[(\bottomdelayeqn)]
        \iltikzfig{circuits/axioms/value-to-register/step-2}
    \]
    Subsequently a circuit in Mealy form can be obtained by applying the
    \((\instantfeedbackeqn)\) rule.
\end{proof}

\(\scircsigma / \mealyequations\) is a category in which all circuits are equal
to at least one circuit in Mealy form.
In general, there will be many Mealy forms depending on the ordering one picks
for the delays and value; our task is to provide equations to map any two
denotationally equivalent circuits to the \emph{same} Mealy form.

Even if the combinational cores of two Mealy forms have the same behaviour, they
may not have the same structure.
To reduce the number of cores we have to consider, we will first establish
equations for translating any combinational circuit into some canonical circuit.
We already met a method for determining what this canonical circuit is: the
functional completeness map \(\mealytofunc\) from \(\funci\) to \(\scircsigma\).

\begin{definition}[Normalised circuit]
    A sequential circuit \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=f,colour=seq,dom=m,cod=n]
    \) is \emph{normalised} if it is in the image of \(\mealytofunc\).
\end{definition}

As a shorthand, we will often abuse notation and write \(
\mealytofunc[f]
\coloneqq
\iltikzfig{strings/category/f-wide}[box=\mealytofunc[f],colour=seq]
\).
Recall that even though \(\mealytofunc\) maps into \(\scircsigma\), every
circuit in its image has combinational behaviour.
This is quite an important distinction to make, so we will give it a proper
name.

\begin{lemma}[Essentially combinational]
    A sequential circuit is \emph{essentially combinational} if it is in the
    form \(
    \iltikzfig{circuits/synthesis/normalised-function}[box=f]
    \).
\end{lemma}

Such circuits are sequential circuits that exhibit combinational behaviour: any
value components are only used to introduce constants which do not alter over
time.

As the normalised version of a given circuit is interpretation-dependent, there
is no standard set of equations for normalising a circuit.
Instead, these must be specified on an interpretation-by-interpretation basis.

\begin{definition}[Normalising equations]
    For a complete interpretation \((\interpretation,\mealytofunc)\), a set of
    equations \(\normalisingequations\) is \emph{normalising} if any
    essentially combinational circuit \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=f,colour=seq,dom=m,cod=n]
    \) is equal to a circuit in the image of \(\mealytofunc\) by equations in
    \(\normalisingequations\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Normalisable interpretation]
    A complete interpretation \(\interpretation\) is called \emph{normalisable} if there
    exists a set of normalising equations \(\normalisingequations\).
\end{definition}

The normalising equations for a given interpretation can be used to translate a
combinational core into a circuit from which it is easy to read off a truth
table.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:normalising}
    For every sequential circuit \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=f,colour=seq,dom=m,cod=n]
    \) in a normalisable complete interpretation
    \((\interpretation,\mealytofunc)\) over \(\Sigma\), there exists essentially
    combinational \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/category/f-2-2-wide}[box=\mealytofunc[g],colour=seq,dom1=x,dom2=m,cod1=x,cod2=n]
    \) and \(\listvar{s} \in \valuetuple{x}\) such that \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=f,colour=seq,dom=m,cod=n]
    =
    \iltikzfig{circuits/productivity/mealy-form-wide}[core=\mealytofunc[g],colour=seq,state=\listvar{s}]
    \) in \(\scircsigma / \mealyequations + \normalisingequations\).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    By \cref{prop:mealy-equations}, \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[box=f,colour=seq,dom=m,cod=n]
    =
    \iltikzfig{circuits/productivity/mealy-form}[core=h]
    \) and by equations in \(\normalisingequations\), \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/category/f-2-2}[box=h,colour=comb]
    =
    \iltikzfig{strings/category/f-2-2-wide}[box=\mealytofunc[g],colour=seq]
    \).
\end{proof}
