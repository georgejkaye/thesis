\chapter{Potential applications}\label{chap:semantics-applications}

So far, we have been concerned largely with \emph{theoretical} concepts; we have
shown how the categorical framework of sequential digital circuits is rigorous
enough to handle composing circuits in sequence, parallel or with the trace
without causing any of the three semantic models to become degenerate.
Unfortunately, this is not enough for people in industry, who are more concerned
with the \emph{practical} benefits of the framework: what can we do with it that
annot already be done?

Circuit design is already a very well-studied area and existing technologies are
incredibly successful.
Our framework is therefore not meant to \emph{replace} the existing
technologies, but to \emph{complement} them by highlighting different
perspectives on reasoning with sequential digital circuits.
While the ideas provided in this section are certainly not industry-grade
applications, they are intended to demonstrate the potential of what
the compositional theory can bring to the table.
