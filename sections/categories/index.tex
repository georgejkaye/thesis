\chapter{A crash course in category theory}

When setting about developing a \emph{mathematical foundation} for something,
the first step is of course to decide exactly what foundation to pick!
In this thesis, our foundation is that of \emph{category theory}, in which
mathematical structures are expressed in terms of \emph{objects} and
\emph{morphisms} between them, which can be composed together.

Category theory has its origins in the early 1940s.
When Eilenberg and Mac Lane were working on problems in algebraic topology, they
set about defining what it meant for a homomorphism to be
`natural'~\cite{eilenberg1942natural}; what we now call a
\emph{natural transformation}.
To do this, they needed to establish a notion of \emph{functors}, between which
natural transformations map.
Later on, to properly work with functors the notion of a \emph{category} was
required; the formal definition was first presented in
1945~\cite{eilenberg1945general}.

It has since turned out that category theory can be used as something of a
`universal language' in mathematics, as many familiar mathematical structures
can be expressed solely in terms of objects and morphisms.
This makes category theory an incredibly powerful tool; rather than having to
repeatedly prove things about concrete structures, abstract results can be
instantiated to a plethora of settings.

\begin{example}
    A common structure in set theory is the \emph{Cartesian product}, in
    which two sets \(A\) and \(B\) can be combined to create a new set
    \(A \times B\) containing pairs of elements \((a,b)\).
    A product is equipped with two functions
    \(\morph{\mathsf{fst}}{A \times B}{A}\) and
    \(\morph{\mathsf{snd}}{A \times B}{B}\) to extract the first and second
    element from a pair respectively.

    Many properties of Cartesian products are not specific to sets,
    but arise from the presence of the two projections.
    In category theory there is a notion of \emph{categorical product} in which
    sets are generalised to objects and the projection functions to morphisms;
    this allows results about products to be applied to a wide range of
    structures in addition to the Cartesian product, such as set intersection,
    greatest lower bounds, greatest common divisors, and more complicated
    algebraic structures.
\end{example}

Category theory has found a good home among computer scientists, as
it can be used to shed new light upon topics such as semantics of programming
languages~\cite{oles1982categorytheoretic}, databases~\cite{spivak2012functorial},
probabilistic programming~\cite{cho2019disintegration,fritz2020synthetic}, and
machine learning~\cite{fong2019backprop,cockett2020reverse}.
Category theory also underpins functional programming languages such as
Haskell and OCaml, which use categorical concepts such as functors and monads
for computational purposes.

One application of category theory we are particularly interested in is that of
\emph{process theories}; here a morphism \(A \to B\) is a process that
transforms some input \(A\) into an output \(B\).
Modelling processes categorically relies on a class of categories known as
\emph{symmetric monoidal categories}~\cite{maclane1963natural}, in which the
usual \emph{sequential} composition is joined by another operation called the
\emph{tensor}, a notion of \emph{parallel} composition.
Our setting of digital circuits introduces another way of creating new things
from simpler components: we can create a \emph{feedback loop} by attaching some
outputs to inputs.
This too can be viewed in a categorical perspective in the form of a
\emph{symmetric traced monoidal category}~\cite{joyal1996traced}.

The use of symmetric monoidal categories to model compositional processes, has
seen an explosion in the past thirty years.
In additional to the aforementioned quantum protocols~\cite{coecke2008interacting},
they have been used in the study of cyclic lambda
calculi~\cite{hasegawa1997recursion}, dynamical
systems~\cite{baez2015categories,fong2016categorical}, signal flow
diagrams~\cite{bonchi2014categorical,bonchi2015full,bonchi2017refinement,bonchi2021survey},
linear algebra~\cite{bonchi2017interacting,zanasi2015interacting,bonchi2019graphical,boisseau2022graphical},
finite-state automata~\cite{piedeleu2021string,piedeleu2022finite}, electrical
circuits~\cite{boisseau2022string}, automatic
differentiation~\cite{alvarez-picallo2023functorial}, synthetic
chemistry~\cite{gale2023categorical}, first order
logic~\cite{bonchi2024diagrammatic}, among many others!

To begin, we will take a meander through the various categorical definitions and
notation that underpin the mathematical work of this thesis.
A similar outline can be found in most category theory textbooks, but
inspiration was taken in particular from the opening of
\cite{ghica2023hierarchical}.
