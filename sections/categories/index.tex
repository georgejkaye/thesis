\chapter{A crash course in category theory}

When setting about developing a \emph{mathematical foundation} for something,
the first step is of course to decide exactly what foundation to pick!
In this thesis, our foundation is that of \emph{category theory}, in which
mathematical structures are expressed in terms of \emph{objects} and
\emph{morphisms} between them.

Category theory has its origins in the early 1940s when Eilenberg and Mac Lane
were working on problems in algebraic topology.
The pair discovered that many homomorphisms were `natural' ;
this led to the notion of \emph{functors} and \emph{natural transformations},
two key categorical concepts which will be explored in
\cref{sec:functors} and \cref{sec:natural-transformations} respectively.
To establish the general framework in which functors and natural transformations
operate, the notion of a \emph{category} was required; Eilenberg and Mac Lane
first presented the definition later in 1945~\cite{eilenberg1945general}.

Since then, the use of category theory has become prevalent in computer science
for all sort of applications.
We are particularly keen on the use of category theory to model
\emph{processes}; here, we use a special kind of category known as a
\emph{symmetric monoidal category}, in which a morphism \(A \to B\) denotes a
process from \(A\) to \(B\).
There has recently been an explosion in the use of symmetric monoidal categories
for modelling of processes, such as for quantum
protocols~\cite{abramsky2004categorical}, signal flow
diagrams~\cite{bonchi2014categorical,bonchi2015full}, linear
algebra~\cite{bonchi2017interacting,zanasi2015interacting,bonchi2019graphical,boisseau2022graphical},
dynamical systems~\cite{baez2015categories,fong2016categorical}, electrical
circuits~\cite{boisseau2022string} and automatic
differentiation~\cite{alvarez-picallo2023functorial}.

Our goal is to apply this methodology to \emph{sequential digital circuits}.
To begin, we will take a meander through the various categorical definitions and
notation that underpin the mathematical work of this thesis.
A similar outline can be found in any category theory textbook, inspiration was
taken in particular from the opening of \cite{ghica2023hierarchical}.
