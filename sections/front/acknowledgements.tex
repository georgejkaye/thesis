The hardest part of writing a thesis is determining exactly who to put in the
acknowledgements.
Of course, the most major influence on this work has been Dan Ghica, who dragged
me kicking and screaming into the world of category theory and set me on the
path I am following today.
But this would have been nowhere near as successfuly without the help of Miriam
Backens, who tirelessly read any paper draft I sent their way and provided all
the annotations one could want.
The influence of David Sprunger can also not be underestimated, as it was his
careful and methodical approach to mathematics that I attempted to emulate in
the latter half of my studies, the success of which will be determined by the
contents of this thesis.
Thanks must also go to Achim Jung and Martín Escardó for providing sage advice
during thesis group meetings, often without sugarcoating!
Finally, thank you to Timothy Bourke and Eric Finster for agreeing to examine
my work, and for Paul Levy for agreeing to keep order as chair.

When studying a PhD in the computer science building, one quickly realises the
need to form a group for to complain about space issues while gorging on
biscuits at cookie breaks.
The natural allegiance that forms is that of fellow theory PhD students, and
Nicolas Blanco, Tom de Jong, Alex Rice, Calin Tataru, Paaras Padhiar, and Ayberk
Tosun.

To say that the personal impact of a small self-hosted Mastodon server has been
large would be an understatement.

The Theory Group at Birmingham is perhaps one of the most vibrant and social
in the field, so it has been a pleasure to be a part of it for the past five
years.
Its members have been so intertwined into my studies that several of them have
already appeared in these acknowledgements, but for their role in making the
Theory Group such a friendly bunch I must also mention including Chris Barrett,
Gianluca Curzi, Anupam Das, Abhishek De, Iris van der Giessen, Marianna
Girlando, Sonia Marin, Sean Moss, Jakub Opršal, Vincent Rahli, Sam Speight, and
Paul Taylor.

A department is only as strong as its administration, and fortunately I have had
the pleasure of working with several diligent and competent members of
Professional Services staff, including Angeliki Bompetsi, Sarah Brookes,
Kate Campbell, Jason Fenemore, Tom Holly, Jamie Hough, Mohammed Idrees,
Wenxuan Pan, Eden Whitehead, and Mohammed Zafar.
Special mention must go to Lydia Eason for the ease at which she operated as
SRSCC secretary while juggling student experience, and also for taking my
request for better wine seriously.
