The hardest part of writing a thesis is determining exactly who to put in the
acknowledgements.
Of course, the most major influence on this work has been Dan Ghica, who dragged
me kicking and screaming into the world of category theory and set me on the
path I am following today.
But this path would not have been followed nearly as well without the help of
Miriam Backens, who tirelessly read any paper draft I sent their way and
provided all the annotations one could want.
The influence of David Sprunger cannot be underestimated, as it was his
careful and methodical approach to mathematics that I attempted to emulate in
the latter half of my studies, the success of which will be determined by the
contents of this thesis.
Thanks must also go to Achim Jung and Martín Escardó for providing sage advice
during thesis group meetings, often without sugarcoating!
Finally, thank you to Timothy Bourke and Eric Finster for agreeing to examine
my work, and for Paul Levy for taking on the role of chair.

The Theory Group at Birmingham is perhaps one of the most vibrant and social
in the field, and I am proud to have been a member and contribute to its
operation.
To me, its biggest strength is in its large ranks of PhD students, which over
the years has included Nicolas Blanco, Tom de Jong, Alex Rice, Calin Tataru,
Paaras Padhiar, and Ayberk Tosun.
The students have been supplemented by an ever-changing army of postdocs,
including Chris Barrett, Gianluca Curzi, Abhishek De, Iris van der Giessen, and
Sam Speight; and last but not least there are the permanent staff keeping things
(not too) serious at the top: among those already mentioned, Anupam Das and
Sonia Marin have played their part.

Immersing oneself wholly in theory for five years would have an extremely
detrimental effect to one's health, so fortunately I have had the pleasure of
associating with numerous non-theory PhD students along the way.
I started alongside Andrea Basso and Charlotte Weitkämper, and with Alex and
Calin we navigated research skills and the various arcane university
progress-tracking mechanisms.
Thanks to a major global event in 2020 this group was splintered, but when
there is a void, something alway springs up to fill the gap.
To say that a Mastodon server self-hosted by Jon Freer has had a large impact on
me would be an understatement, and thanks to this tight-knit community I have
enjoyed countless entertaining shenanigans with Matthew Bowden, Dhurim Cakiqi,
Anna Clee, Matthew Hammond, Tobias Schmude, Charlie Street, Yánrong Wang, and
Jacob Thomas Whitnell Wilson.

A department is only as strong as its administration, and fortunately I have had
the pleasure of working with several diligent and competent members of
Professional Services staff, including Angeliki Bompetsi, Sarah Brookes,
Kate Campbell, Jason Fenemore, Tom Holly, Jamie Hough, Mohammed Idrees,
Wenxuan Pan, Eden Whitehead, and Mohammed Zafar.
Special mention must go to Lydia Eason for the ease at which she operated as
SRSCC secretary while juggling student experience, and also for taking my
request for better wine seriously.

If you've been following closely, you might notice that some names are missing.
I thrive in a double act and have been fortunate enough to be part of several,
usually alternating as either straight man or foil based solely on whim.
For better or for worse, Todd Waugh Ambridge has been there since the beginning,
pointing out my most egregious errors and sharing countless balcony chats with
tea and biscuits; with him I have exerted extreme amounts of corner pressure at
pretty much every social gathering.
Bruno da Rocha Paiva has been a near-constant office companion for the past two
years; perhaps his presence has made progress on this thesis slower than it
could have been thanks to running all over the building engaging in mischief,
but it would not have been nearly as interesting.
Jacqueline Henes has acted as an incredibly capable SRSCC chair and provided a
secon perspective to the issues PGRs face; together we have battled operational
issues galore and without her determination the PGR community would be in a much
graver state.

Charlotte was nice to have around too.
