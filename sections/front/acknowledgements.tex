\markboth{Acknowledgements}{Acknowledgements}

Thanks to Bruno da Rocha Paiva for pointing out I needed 1em more space between
my commutative diagrams, and for mansplaining unitality to me, and for telling
me to use \(\dots\) rather than \(\cdots\).
Thanks also to Dr Todd Waugh Ambridge for suggesting that I should use 1.5em
line spacing.
